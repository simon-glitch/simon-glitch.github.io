I feel like making a canvas app.

# What this app is
Taochi is a canvas webapp. It uses innovative and unique controls, and is designed to allow for "modular" digital artwork.

Much of the controls and menu options focus on mathematical patterns, rather than hand-drawn designs.

Interactions with the canvas and even with the menu can be automated and stream-lined.

Everything is automatically stored in the "cookie". The cookie can also be downloaded.

See [controls.md](controls.md) for information on the controls.
