# Intro
I've come up with a new idea for a very useful programming language.

:D

I'll call it `fefi` for now.

# Contents
This project, called `fifo` involves multiple different languages and pieces of software. Let's clarify what each of them is and how they all work:
* `fifo` - the project name
    * yes, I know "`fifo`" is a term to describe a queue; no one is going to confuse the 2;
* `fefi`
    * a high-level programming language that is designed to either be:
        * compiled to machine code;
        * or be run in an interpreter; each interpreter can use its own VM and VM code;
* `fifarn`
    * a compiled intermediate language (like `LLVM`);
    * designed to be compiled further to machine code;
* `folofarn`
    * VM code used by the `fifo` VM;
* `fefoo`
    * language to configure the compilers that compile `fefi` and `fifarn` code;
        * i.e. this configures the `fifo` compilers, and any similar compilers;
    * can also configure applications and programs generated by the `fifo` compilers;
        * so, for example, one could add options to their `fefi` library for other programmers to configure; when the `fefi` library is compiled to a repo, it will have options that can be configured externally; options can be applied at compile-time, at install-time, at import-time, or at run-time;
    * this could also be used to configure other programs and applications;
        * i.e. programs unrelated to `fifo` and the other languages listed here;
* `fifo` compiler
    * a tool that compiles `fefi` to machine code
    * this tool has 2 components: the `fefum` and `fifum` compilers
    * has an API combining the ones in the `fifum` and `fefum` compilers;
* `fifo` compilers
    * refers to the `fifo`, `fefum`, and `fifum` compilers;
* `fefum` compiler
    * compiles `fefi` code to `LLVM` or `fifarn`
    * not machine specific
    * has an API like one in the `fifum` compiler;
* `fifum` compiler
    * compiles `fifarn` code to machine code
    * machine specific
    * has support for multi-step installation processes;
        * can create installers to install programs and applications;
    * allows multiple executables and libraries to be created during the compiling process;
    * these additional abilities make it comparable to tools such as `Visual Studio`;
        * but it doesn't have a UI or IDE like `Visual Studio`;
    * it does have an API that supports console commands;
        * the API is file based and can do extra work for specific folders;
* `fifo` interpreter
    * this tool has 2 components: the `folofo` compiler and the `fifo` VM;
    * has 2 variants:
        * `fifo` headless interpreter
            * runs `fefi` and `folofarn` code in a program or application generated by the `fifo` compilers;
        * `fifo` ECMAScript interpreter
            * uses `ECMAScript`, `WebAssembly`, and GPU tools to run `fefi` and `folofarn` code in some browsers;
* `folofo` compiler
    * compiles `fefi` code to `folofarn` code
    * if the `fefi` uses certain features that are only supported in certain contexts, the compiled VM code won't work outside those contexts; for example, you can't modify files in the headless interpreter;
* `fifo` VM
    * virtual machine (VM) that runs folofarn code directly;
    * again, certain features only work when the VM has access to them;
    * this "virtual machine" is actually an API; interpreters using it are expected use its API calls to work with it;
* `fefi` library
    * a library created using the `fifo` compiler
    * the library can be composed of a combination of:
        * `fefi` files
        * `fifarn` files
        * machine-specific files, such as "linked libraries" recognized by the machine
    * library must also contain a ``fefoo`` file to describe its structure, called `format.fefoo`;
        * `format.fefoo` is read by the compiler or interpreter using the library, and should not be modified after the library is compiled or installed;
    * a library can also have templates for ``fefoo`` files that configure the library;
    * a library can be used by a program in 1 of 3 ways:
        * using a "linked library" via the machine or the OS running the program;
        * importing the library at the program's runtime; this can be done in multiple ways:
            * running another program (executable) from within the library, and using the OS to establish the library;
            * loading `fefi`, fefarn, or `fifarn` code into an interpreter or virtual machine;
            * sending machine code directly to the program using it (i.e. "self-modifying code");
        * compiling code from the library directly into the program using it;

# Summary
This project is named ``fifo``.

``fifo`` includes multiple specific pieces of software, as tools related to the ``fefi`` language:
* an interpreter, with 2 variants, and its own VM
* a compiler, with its own intermediate language, and 2 compilers built around that intermediate language;
* support for libraries, called "``fefi`` libraries"

Additionally, ``fifo`` includes 4 languages:
* ``fefi``
* ``fifarn``
* ``folofarn``
* ``fefoo``
