I've come up with a new idea for a very useful programming language.

I'll call it fefi for now.

This project, called fifo involves multiple different languages and pieces of software. Let's clarify what each of them is and how they all work:
* fifo - the project name
    * yes, I know "fifo" is a term to describe a queue; no one is going to confuse the 2;
* fefi
    * a high-level programming language that is designed to either be:
        * compiled to machine code;
        * or be run in an interpreter; each interpreter can use its own VM and VM code;
* fifarn
    * a compiled intermediate language (like LLVM);
    * designed to be compiled further to machine code;
* folofarn
    * VM code used by the fifo VM;
* fifo compiler
    * a tool that compiles fefi to machine code
    * this tool has 2 components: the fefum and fifum compilers
    * has an API combining the ones in the fifum and fefum compilers;
* fifo compilers
    * refers to the fifo, fefum, and fifum compilers;
* fefum compiler
    * compiles fefi code to LLVM or fifarn
    * not machine specific
    * has an API like one in the fifum compiler;
* fifum compiler
    * compiles fifarn code to machine code
    * machine specific
    * has support for multi-step installation processes;
        * can create installers to install programs and applications;
    * allows multiple executables and libraries to be created during the compiling process;
    * these additional abilities make it comparable to tools such as VS code;
        * but it doesn't have a UI or IDE like VS code;
    * it does have an API that supports console commands;
        * the API is file based and can do extra work for specific folders;
* fifo interpreter
    * this tool has 2 components: the folofo compiler and the fifo VM;
    * has 2 variants:
        * fifo headless interpreter
            * runs fefi and folofarn code in a program or application generated by the fifo compilers;
        * fifo ECMAScript interpreter
            * uses ECMAScript, WebAssembly, and GPU tools to run fefi and folofarn code in some browsers;
* folofo compiler
    * compiles fefi code to folofarn code
    * if the fefi uses certain features that are only supported in certain contexts, the compiled VM code won't work outside those contexts; for example, you can't modify files in the headless interpreter;
* fifo VM
    * virtual machine (VM) that runs folorfarn code directly;
    * again, certain features only work when the VM has access to them;
    * this "virtual machine" is actually an API; interpreters using it are expected use its API calls to work with it;
* fefoo
    * language to configure the fifo compilers;
    * can also configure applications and programs generated by the fifo compilers;
        * so, for example, one could add options to their fefi library for other programmers to configure; when the fefi library is compiled to a repo, it will have options that can be configured externally; options can be applied at compile-time, at install-time, at import-time, or at run-time;
* fefi library
    * a library created using the fifo compiler
    * the library can be composed of a combination of:
        * fefi files
        * fifarn files
        * machine-specific files, such as "linked libraries" recognized by the machine
    * a library should not contain fefoo configuration files, except for templates, unless a fefoo file is require in order to use the library;
    * a library can be used by a program in 1 of 3 ways:
        * using a "linked library" via the machine or the OS running the program;
        * importing the library at the program's runtime; this can be done in multiple ways:
            * running another program (executable) from within the library, and using the OS to establish the library;
            * loading fefi, fefarn, or fifarn code into an interpreter or virtual machine;
            * sending machine code directly to the program using it (i.e. "self-modifying code");
        * compiling code from the library directly into the program using it;
