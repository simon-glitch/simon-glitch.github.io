
# Infinitely distinct

Every object that is different instance has unlimited capacity to be unique. Every person can be unique in a myriad of ways, even when they fit into all of the typical social norms. Every location is unique, even if it looks the same as the next location. There are always tiny and minute differences. Some sentences and statements might be repeated (like this one), but the context in which each occurence is uttered is still unique.

# Everything is unique.

Going further, everything has exceptions. There is no global rule that can be applied to every object, unless the objects are defined and selected in an extremely specific way to begin with. There are very facts that we can be sure of, and everything can be questioned.
