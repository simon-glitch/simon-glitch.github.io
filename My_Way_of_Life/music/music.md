
I'm getting pretty annoyed trying to learn music, because I can't get definitions for the most basic pieces of terminology.

The more I think about this, the more I feel like I should hate music *theory*, even though I love music. Being honest, I simply hate the lack of clarification by people who write about music theory. If you are someone who has ever done any writing on this subject, please avoid every talking to me, because we will only ever have angry arguments.

Terms I don't comprehend at all and am going to spend the next week trying to understand:
* note
* frequency
* pitch
* tone
* overtone
* duration
* rythm
* meter
* beat
* measure
* line
* accented
* movement of music (how can music move if it's not a physical object?)
* 
* 
* 

So, a **note** does have a **pitch**. And the pitch is the most prominent **frequency** in the note. Wikepedia says pitch is a perceived phenomenon, but it's not. Pitch is only defined as the perception of frequency when the main frequency can *not* be correctly perceived. As long as the present sounds are easy enough to understand for the listener, the 2 things are the exact same thing with no differences at all.

A **tone** includes a pitch. To be more exact, {a tone} = {a pitch: the main frequency in the tone} + {**overtones**: the secondary frequencies of the tone}. Different instruments can produce different tones (and thus different overtones) when playing notes with the same pitch. i.e. the main frequency in the sounds produced by 2 instruments can be the same, but the overtones are different.

The prominence of an overtone is how noticeable it is (and how much it distracts the listener from the pitch).

A human can sing a tone, but can't really sing *(just)* a pitch, since every voice has an overtone attached to it.
* A pitch is the main sound that a human is trying to produce.
* A tone is the combined *(true / full)* sound being produced instead.
* A note is the tone + duration + *other small details*.
