
I'm getting pretty annoyed trying to learn music, because I can't get definitions for the most basic pieces of terminology.

Terms I don't comprehend at all and am going to spend the next week trying to understand:
* note
* pitch
* duration
* 
* 
* 
* 
* rythm
* meter
* beat
* measure
* line
* accented
* movement of music (how can music move if it's not a physical object?)
* 
* 
*
