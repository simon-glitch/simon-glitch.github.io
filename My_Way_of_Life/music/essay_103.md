## Final Paper Assignment Instructions

Throughout this course we have worked on developing critical listening skills for engaging with music. In addition to considering the materials of music and their role in the formation of musical styles, we have used my four-fold approach to listening well (“The Posture of Listening”): Attention, Charity, Discernment, and Delight. We have found that thoughtful engagement with music requires familiarity with the specific social and historical contexts in which musical works are composed, performed, and experienced by listeners. And we have found that the music of the Western classical tradition draws upon the history of movement and dance as well as theatre and other art forms. And we have seen that the music that people enjoyed and found meaningful and useful in the past can still inspire and entertain us today.

Write an essay about what you would consider to be your most notable encounter with music this semester. This could be a specific work or several works that we listened to this semester. This may be music you were already familiar with or music you encountered for the first time in this course. This may also be music you heard performed in a concert (about which you wrote in your concert reports). Think about how listening with attention, charity, discernment and delight informed your listening and enjoyment. Think about how musicians made use of melody, harmony, rhythm, tone color, texture, and form. Think about how social circumstances and historical context affected the composition of music as well as your engagement with it. Think also about how your experience of music has changed you. What have you discovered about music and about yourself that you might not have considered before? What difference has this made to your sense of what music is and how we can best understand and enjoy it?

Your essay must be at least 750 words, but not more than 1000 words. Include all of the following:

1. Your name and class/section information
2. A title for your essay
3. An introduction and a conclusion.
4. Several paragraphs, each of which develops a single aspect of your overall argument/thesis.

My rubrics for evaluation of written work are in the syllabus. Please note that the overall quality of your writing will be considered as a factor in the final grade.

Upload your essay in Moodle no later than 11:59 pm, Tuesday, April 30, 2024.

# Note
My name is Simon. This is the essay for the {Music 103 – Understanding and Enjoying Music} course. By the way, I would like to warn you: this essay is just a sequence of statements. Also, the essay on "A Posture of Listing" has lots of small content issues, but I don't need to criticize it for that. *But, why does it have a Works Cited section when it is clearly based on personal opinion?*

My most notable encounter with music this semester was simply the act of being introduced to music theory. I don't know how other students felt, but I was completely overwhelmed with a huge amount of terminology and hundreds of concepts that I know nothing about. I have been trying to understand some of the basics, but I still have no idea how to fully "listen to" a song (as the textbook implies the definition of listening). It has been a very challenging experience, and the challenge has been fun to accept. I really have never thought about any of these things, and I haven't developed any of the basic skills needed for understanding music.

Listening with attention is what I usually need to do in order to remember a song well. I enjoy giving my attention to most things, especially anything with patterns or inherent beauty, which 99.9% of all music has. I am not a fan of idly "listening" to music, and I don't play music when I am doing other things. On a rare occasion, I do sit and listen to a song that I think is cool though. Listening with charity means practicing patience. I have always had problems with my own childish and impatient behavior, and I am actively working on being a more patient person. Therefore, I have been practing listening (and performing all conceivable actions) with charity for the past 6 years. I don't listen with discernment, because I see culture as a separate form of art (all on its own), and I prefer to analyze artwork in the most personalized way possible. I usually find it personally appealing to separate something into its object parts and its emotional parts, and then discard any leftover subjective parts because they distract (or disrupt) my thought process. Then I criticize every connection between the objective parts and the emotions, I internalize the emotions, and I expand on the patterns of the objective parts. This is very much not the same as all of the religious and cultural stuff mentioned in the section of you listening guide on "Listening with discernment". I also don't listen with delight either. I seek ways to make myself more mature, but I don't care if a piece of music sounds mature. Music can't be wise, and I hardly care if it "reflects" wisdom. Wholeness is also not important to me. I do seek my own personal joy and "health" (whatever this "health" is, I probably seek it out), but those are pretty instinctual things, and they aren't related to the other things I just listed. Not all music is immediately pleasing, but if you listen with charity then it should be much more pleasurable.

I hardly understand the basics of music and the components of a song. I understand what notes are, and I could perform a song well enough for other people to recognize it, but I am not a music theory expert. You said we don't need to know music theory, so I am going to tell you right now: I can't think about how musicians use "melody, harmony, rhythm, tone color, texture, and form" if I don't understand what those things are. Fortunately, I do understand what melody and harmony are, because they are mathematically obvious. I don't understand what the difference between color and texture are though (it would help if I could visually see actual colors or textures in a song). I also don't understand form, and I disagree with inquisitive half of the time about it. Don't even get me started on non-mathematical words like "slow" and "fast". If music was just based on my emotional reaction to it, then I would be satisfied, but the musical community seems to enjoy discussing these things and coming to consensuses on various details of various songs. Anyways, I understand many of these things at a conceptual level, but I have no idea how other people classify or perceive them, and I don't understand them really well. Finally, I would like to say that I can't perceive meter, tempo, or rythm properly, because my ears always pick up every single note in a song and store the notes in order.

I can't understand music without having the proper musical perception skills, and I can't acquire those skills quickly by listening to complex songs. I assume that I am not the only person who is like this, and that my statements here probably seem like out-of-place complaints. I apologize if it seems like I am upset here. I am not upset, and I am simply reporting the difficulties I have experienced during this course, because these difficulties are the most important part of my experience with music this semester, in my opinion.

Thinking about how "social circumstances and historical context affected the composition of music" is the same as listening with discernment, which I usually don't do because it doesn't fit my thinking style or learning style.

I am pretty sure my experience of music hasn't changed me. However, the challenge of learning music theory and perceiving the fine details of what I am listening to has challanged me enough to require me to reconsider the parts of myself that I use for perceiving auditory information. I will never listen to the leaves rustle the same way, and I will better understand my emotional reactions to sound in the future. However, I don't feel like the core parts of my personality have been significantly changed by these things. I have to search deep within my soul to find the faint and thin traces of the impact left by this challenge of improving my musical perception and understanding. What I believe music is and how and I define hasn't been changed at all. I still believe that music is just amusing (or emotionally stimulating) patterns caused by sounds, and the art of music is to use {harmony, note length, delay between notes, and the patterns of the overtones in the notes} in order to produce the intended {{emotional affects} and/or {communicated message}} for the listener.
