I just watched this video [Why Aren't There Any Good Christian Games?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COiNrIM9KVE). It really opened my mind to a new perspective (a new theory) on American pessimism. First, I would like to give some context on what I mean.

All the time, I hear people complain about "generational" issues and problems. I hear older people saying younger people are lazy, incompetent, and too emotionally weak. I also hear younger people complaining about how older people are too stuck in their ways and are short sighted by their intellectual (conceptual) tunnel vision. So, there is clearly some kind of problem or dilema here, right? There seems to be a debetable topic with 2 sides. Let's call this problem: the {"generational" trends problem}. Now, it is well known that when there are 2 or more sides, one should "listen to every side". It is common knowledge (common sense; common education) that it is optimal for the listener to consider every side. However, I don't follow this common knowledge. I believe that in most situations, one should only consider some sides. Internally, I use an algorithm to figure out which sides are optimal to listen to and consider. With this stated, you will be able to understand the implications of the next statement: as far as the {"generational" trends problem} is concerned, I have determined that it is optimal for me to consider both sides. Furthermore, I have determined that I should not fully take a side on the issue. Thus, I disagree with almost every generation on the {"generational" trends problem}. I believe that I should remain open minded and never let myself get stuck in my ways. And I also believe that I should research the history of every tradition I see and consider the usefulness of it. I believe that the older a tradition is, the more time I should give towards researching and consideriing it, since older traditions are less likely to have flaws. Well, every conceivable thing has infinitely many flaws. When I say "[A] is less likely to have flaws", I mean "the probability of a flaw of [A] causing an issue in a random situation is less likely". And "less likely" is being weighed against an implied list of alternative traditions and {ways of living}, which I will not bother to list or discuss here.

# Pessimism?
Yeah. To me, many people in this world seem to pessimistic.
* and many of the people who aren't pessimistic are way too ignorant instead.

It is a real hassle, dealing with everyone else's pessimism. I am really content with my life and the way the world is. I know I am just a spoild American, but I see other equally spoiled Americans who are not content with what they **already have**, and who demand more. It is quite the strange phenomenon. And when I say "other Americans", I don't mean "rich people". And when I say "not content", I am not referring to "corporate greed". The problem I see is that people just can't deal with suffering. I understand their disliking of pain. I too experience pain, and I go to great efforts to avoid pain. But ... I just feel like maybe people should complain about it less often. I guess this is more of an issue of the necessity of communication. We don't need to share (vocalize) every tiny bit of suffering we experience. So, I feel like we should just avoid talking about our suffering when there isn't very much to learn from it.
