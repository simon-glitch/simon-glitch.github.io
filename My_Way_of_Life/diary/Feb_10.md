# Meta comment about diaries
I remember making a diary in my text editor like this a while back. I'm not sure where those are though. I guess I'll look for them some time.

I did find an excerpt of one of my old diaries ... I think it's from 7th or 8th grade! It's really crazy how I used to think back then. I can see strong themes of how much I cared about learning about other people. No wonder I understand other people so well now ... I guess my passion and diligence led to me learning a lot about other people.

# Inclination to just record
I suddenly feel inclined to write about today's events. Maybe I *really do just* want future Simon to read this and see personality traits showing through my combination of writing style, word choice, and word emphasis. Maybe he will learn something useful. You never know! In fact, he might read the comment and think: *"What happened to my commitment to learning for the sake of learning? What happpened to my passion and energy?"*. Well, future Simon, that sounds like a personal failure that you have to come back out of. You know, part of me sees me being able to avoid ever coming into that state of being. Another part of me sees at as a very feasible future potential state of being. I guess I **should** make that great effort to avoid losing my passion and energy for learning!

You know what, writing this has made me feel a lot better! And now I am convinced that I should record what happened today so far, just for the sake of it. Besides, I am feeling quite comfortable right now, and I think the task will make me better at weiting!

*Yeah, as I thought about my mixed feelings during the #Hair_cut, I realized that I really should record some of my feelings, just for the sake of:
* ... improving my present understanding of those feelings.
* ... providing a record for my self to improve his understanding of those feelings,
    * and improve future understandings of further future feelings in the further future.

Also, the more I think about how I really should record more things in the diary *(at least, when I feel like it!)*: about my feelings (while explaining related events).

## Hair cut
Papa took me to the barber and I got my haircut. I honestly did have mixed feelings about the hair cut.
* On one hand, I want to grow my hair out and see what the long curls look like.
* On the other hand, I don't have the time or passion to do that and take care of the hair in order to accomplish that.


## SIM card
For some reason, my phone can't detect its sim card. I have no idea how to take the thing out. I search the physical phone for it, but I didn't find any signs of a sim card that's accessible from the outside. I guess I will have to find the sim card tomorrow. Hopefully it doesn't say lost like my bus card and key that I lost 2 weeks ago (January 29, 2024).

I'm guessing that either the sim card's firmware crashed, or the hardware got dislodged from some connector and the phone can't read the data accurately. Either way, the sim card is disconnected now (the phone says it's "missing" or "absent" or something like that).

## Cat fist
When I was a little kid, I always hated the idea of eating catfish. My maternal grandpa liked to catch them and even brought one over one time. That one time, he mentioned eating it and asked if I was hypothetically supportive of the idea of having myself eat it. I never was. I found the idea disgusting because I thought it would {taste like and be textured like} a cat. Cat fur is obviously disgusting, especially if you mix with seaweed (which I find disgusting) and cold dirty water (which is also unpleasant).

My grandpa never actually cooked it (at my house), and I was never told to eat it. I never saw, smelled, or tasted it, but I was strangely afraid of the idea of my grandpa cooking it up for us.
* I really wasn't very rational as a little kid.
* I was also afraid of everything my grandpa said and did, but I was never afriad of my grandpa as himself.
    * I think I was just scared by his energy and enthusiasm.
    * Now I actually admire it.
        * Too bad he's head, I guess?
        * I might be a psychopath, since it doesn't matter to me anyways.

Now I understand that catfish might actually taste great. If someone offered it, I would try my best to keep an optimistic attitude, just like I usually do with most new things. The subconscious version of my younger self will probably try to upset me though.


# I'm tired now?
4:52 report - I apparenlty feel physically exhausted. I did just do something that would make most guys exhausted (*wink*), but usually that's not an issue for me. I guess I'm just not managing my adrenaline and melatonin well enough.
* Stupid melatonin, leave me alone.
* Believe it or not, I find this somewhat annoying, but I'm not feeling that very much because the melatonin is doing wonders and I have zero angry chemicals in my head right now.
* Hmm... my anger when I was a child felt like this sometimes.
    * Although, I usually had the anger chemicals.
    * There have always been occasions where I have what I know are reasons to be upset and just don't feel upset.
    * I think that's because I can trivially tolerate / cope with the occasion.
    * I'm not really sure if I agree with this list of claims I just made, but I was really trying to express how I feel in those claims.
    * Well, I guess some things are just hard to explain.
