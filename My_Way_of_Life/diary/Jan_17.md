Like, really cold. However, I think it might actually be a little less cold than yesterday. Still, getting here on the bus was pretty grueling. Nonetheless, I feel fine right now. I'm not like afraid of the cold or anything XD. Seriously though, I'm emotionally strong enough to handle it just fine!

# Waiting for class
I'm waiting for class here in the "DeVos Communication Center", and there are a lot of students. Of course, I really am introverted, so I won't talk to any of them. Besides, what would I take to them about? Would I tell them how I feel like a failure sometimes for not ambitiously doing my programming projects? Well, I guess most other people can empathize with that, but ... I don't know. I really do prefer being alone with my thoughts most of the time. There are 6 people in my head, so I never get lonely.

Anyways, it's time for class now, I guess.

# I should improve my typing speed
At least, if I am going to write all of these small and miniscule little words, a faster typing speed would be beneficial.

I am actually practicing a loose closest finger approach right now, and it's turning out to be quite fun! Actually, maybing having your fingers misaligned with the keyboard is actually optimal somehow?

# Ways you know that you're Autistic
I made eye contact with someone a few minutes ago. I was way above them on a higher floor, so they definitely noticed me out of the "upper peripheral" of their vision. I'm almost surprised that people make eye contact so willingly without any special reason to do so!

Of course, I should just stop being so antisocial and have a normal perspective on the whole matter, but hey!" I am me, and me is *(probably)* autistic.
