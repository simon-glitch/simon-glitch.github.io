Like, really cold. However, I think it might actually be a little less cold than yesterday. Still, getting here on the bus was pretty grueling. Nonetheless, I feel fine right now. I'm not like afraid of the cold or anything XD. Seriously though, I'm emotionally strong enough to handle it just fine!

# Waiting for class
I'm waiting for class here in the "DeVos Communication Center", and there are a lot of students. Of course, I really am introverted, so I won't talk to any of them. Besides, what would I take to them about? Would I tell them how I feel like a failure sometimes for not ambitiously doing my programming projects? Well, I guess most other people can empathize with that, but ... I don't know. I really do prefer being alone with my thoughts most of the time. There are 6 people in my head, so I never get lonely.

Anyways, it's time for class now, I guess.

# I should improve my typing speed
At least, if I am going to write all of these small and miniscule little words, a faster typing speed would be beneficial.

I am actually practicing a loose closest finger approach right now, and it's turning out to be quite fun! Actually, maybing having your fingers misaligned with the keyboard is actually optimal somehow?

# Ways you know that you're Autistic
I made eye contact with someone a few minutes ago. I was way above them on a higher floor, so they definitely noticed me out of the "upper peripheral" of their vision. I'm almost surprised that people make eye contact so willingly without any special reason to do so!

Of course, I should just stop being so antisocial and have a normal perspective on the whole matter, but hey!" I am me, and me is *(probably)* autistic.

Okay, after thinking about it for a minute, I have come to the conclusion that eye contact is not special at all. In fact, I would even argue that many instances of eye contact are simply 2 people watching each other. People (therefore) often look at other people's eyes for 1 of 2 reasons:
* to see exactly what the other person is looking at (by directly checking the pupil)
* or to see the other person's face, so one can infer what emotions the other person is experiencing.

However, I am pretty introverted (and/or probably autistic), so I wish there was more to eye contact than just that. I'd like to believe it's some kind of special (or advanced) form of communication. However, eye contact seems to merely be the result of mutual ("mutual" means "2-way and shared") attention. Of course, eye contact can be taken advantage of and used as a form of communication, but it doesn't typically initialize as a form of communication. The "communicating via the eyes" aspect is merely an auxilery function.

# Being a programmer
You know, being a programmer, I have become kind of obsessed over certain terms, like "function". I use it all the time and know exactly what it means, but most people almost never use it. To be honest I am amazed (no, baffled and confused) that most people don't use it in their standard vernacular (which means "everyday casual vocabulary").

# Random Twitching?
Sometimes, I get this random vibration in my penis. It's an actual vibration. I think it happens when the prostrate does a random twitch. It's quite intense but lasts for a little less than a second. I tried googling this, and all I got was that apparently muscles randomly twitch sometimes. I am very sure that it's the muscles of the prostrate area randomly pulsing (spasming) just once or twice (keep in mind: an individual muscle spasm lasts only 1/2 of a second).
