
I'm waiting for class here in the "DeVos Communication Center", and there are a lot of students. Of course, I really am introverted, so I won't talk to any of them. Besides, what would I take to them about? Would I tell them how I feel like a failure sometimes for not ambitiously doing my programming projects? Well, I guess most other people can empathize with that, but ... I don't know. I really do prefer being alone with my thoughts most of the time. There are 6 people in my head, so I never get lonely.

Anyways, it's time for class now, I guess.
