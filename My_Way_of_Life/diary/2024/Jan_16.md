Today I am finally back at Calvin University after we took a few weeks off for {Christmas / New Year's} break.

# Psych
I just listened to / read the syllabus for the psychology course and I am a bit more excited about it than I thought I'd be. I'm coming up with all of these new ideas about my latest theory (see [mind_theory](../mind_theory.md) for info) on how the human mind works. I hope the professor will be interested in hearing my ideas (or even reading a personal essay of mine of them).

I'm also excited about connecting my new theory to some mathematical / proof stuff.

# Chrome Theme
I managed to fix my theme in Chrome so now it's back to the old one! You see, the new version of Chrome doesn't have the same color theme options that the old version of Chrome had. I was able to use the old version of Chrome while on one of the lab machines in my CS Lab here at the university. Isn't that nice?! It sure is!
