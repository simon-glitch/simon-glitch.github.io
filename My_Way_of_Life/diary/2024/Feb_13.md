# I don't like jekyll
I may or may not be upset with jekyll trying to prevent my commits from going through just because of some `{{double curly brackets}}`. I understand that it's supposed to be convenience filter for some people, but all it did for me was trip me up. XD.

I guess I'm feeling okay though and I'm not really that upset. I was pretty surprised to see my commits get denied like that though!
