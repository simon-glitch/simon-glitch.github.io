It is **so** foggy today! Yesterday, we had rain. This past week, we've had lots of snow. Today, instead of getting precipitation, we get fog. I can say: I definitely prefer fog over rain and snow. The temperature has gone up quite a bit, so I don't feel like I'm freezing when I'm outside, and I also like that stuff doesn't get wet.

# Lost My Bus Card
On tuesday, I came in to class with a wet coat, and I was late, because I left my bus card at home. Speaking of which, I still need to find where I left my bus card in my house XD. I was thinking of doing it on Tuesday, but I never bothered searching. I though of it again on Wednesday, but decided not to then too. This is called **procrastination** XD. I've been using my dad's card ... but my dad is going to need his card back eventually, so he can go to BioLife.

Ugh, my dad really needs a job. He's been without one for the past 3 years now. Like, how do you do that? Ughh. I'm not angry about it, but I am disappointed, and I do despise my dad, *a really tiny bit*.

# Minecraft Wiki
I've also been messing around on the Minecraft wiki a lot lately, instead of doing programming. I'm always telling myself I should do one of my many programming projects, but I never have the motivation. To be fair though, I do have a lot of other skills that I need to improve. So, I have been getting lots of experience in other things, like writing for the Minecraft wiki, and I'm becoming a much more talented individual (overall) as a result. I've also focused a lot on my emotional development. You know, emotional development is important. I need to mature. I need to not just think like an adult, but also **feel** like one (i.e. I need the emotional understanding that an adult has).

## Emotions?
You know, I could go on and on for hours about emotions. I feel like no one else ever says the right things about them. Most people act like emotions are complex, subjective, and poorly defined. Mine are almost only the 1st thing.
* Even then, only some of my emotions are complex. Also, the details and components of my complex emotions are all individually simple, so the emotions aren't very complex at a fundamental level.
* How are **MY** emotion not subject? - you ask. Well, - I answer - emotions are not subject, because I actually **know** what I am feeling and can understand it. However, I should clarify, that some of my emotions **are difficult** for me to understand. Therefore, some of my emotions are (essentially) subjective.
* My emotions are quite well defined though. I keep coming up with new definitions too. I have this system for describing emotions as a structure in my mental space, and it is quite encompassing. I haven't found any emotions that aren't **eventually** classified and described by the system. As I said though, there are some emotions that I can't understand of classify yet. Many of the emotions I could classify in the past, are now much better understood and have been classified properly.

### Nostalgia
Nostalgia is a great example of an emotion that I used to not understand. I used to thing nostalgia was a part of my decision making, like "I like that door, so I should use it as my example here". Just recently, I realized that nostalgia is highly emotional. However, unlike other emotions, nostalgia doesn't usually lead to unwise or harmful decisions. Nostalgia is definitely the most trust-worthy emotion, but you should still focus on not trusting it too much.

# Energy Level
The new consciousness I created sure does have a lot of energy. It's kinda hard to handle. Well, more like it's kinda annoying to handle.

At least I can actually socialize with people now. The new consciousness is actually pro-social AND not an introvert. All of the other consciousnesses are introverted for one reason or another:
* fear of getting hurt
* fear of hurting others
* fear of being rejected
* fear of wasting other people's time
* contempt for huamn stupidity and contempt for the fact that communication is even needed in the first place

That last one is ... pretty hateful. But he's actually a really helpful guy. He just doesn't want to have to think about anything that's not inside my head. He basically has a "fear of going outside (the mental space)". He is super good at understanding the mental space though, and he is good at making tools for the consciousnesses to use. To be honest, I don't know what exactly he does ... but I guess I'll just have to find out.

Ah, anyways, back to consciousness 6. Apparently it only takes me 20 minutes to swap consciosnesses now.
