I just noticed 2 students pressing their hands on their foreheads while staring down at their screens.

And it made me wonder:
* when people put their hand on their forehead, does that mean they are confused

Well, I'm pretty sure the answer is obviously yes. For some reaosn, I feel like there is more to this ... but I don't know what more there could be (or should be) exactly. Well, anyways, I hope they are having as much fun learning as I usually do. All I can do is simply hope for the best for them, right?

# New writing goal!
I'm thinking about writing a long essay (or a short book) on writing styles. And of course, I'll be including it here on GitHub. Ever since January of last year (2023), I've been thinking about and exploring writing styles. When I wrote my research paper for my highschool, I changed my academic writing style quite a bit. My new style much more accurately matched my real thoughts and opinions.

Over the past 12 months, I've explored and analyzed every writing style there is. Believe it or not, there are more writing styles than you'd think!

# An optical effect I just noticed! - this is way too random!
I'm sitting in this seat at the college, and there is this thin wall of fabric on the side of the seat. I think it's there to help give you personal space, but it seems to be on the wrong side (it's facing the open area of the room, rather than facing the hallway section). Anyways, it's made of 2 layers of fabric and blocks ~70% of the light coming through it. The light that does come through makes these cool patterns, which shift and bend when you move (or change your perspective). This is a classic case of 2 layers of dithering and how perspective changes the intersection patterns on the 2 dithers. Or at least, that's (essentially) my best explanation.

# Wow, apparenlty I don't feel like trash today
In fact, I'm feeling great / amazing today! I almost don't know how or why ... almost. I do just **barely** understand why I'm feeling good today though. It's because my subconscious did a great job on maturing and improving my current (new) consciousness last night. This consciousness was created on Saturday, and was made the primary consciousness on Monday, and it's feeling great. Ah, I love being able to construct new consciousnesses. It really is a luxury beyond any other.
