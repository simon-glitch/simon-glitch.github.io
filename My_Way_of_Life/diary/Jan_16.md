
Today I am finally back at Calvin University after we took a few weeks off for {Christmas / New Year's} break.

# Psych
I just listened to / read the syllabus for the psychology course and I am a bit more excited about it than I thought I'd be. I'm coming up with all of these new ideas about my latest theory (see [mind_theory](../mind_theory.md) for info) on how the human mind works. I hope the professor will be interested in hearing my ideas (or even reading a personal essay of mine of them).

I'm also excited about connecting my new theory to some mathematical / proof stuff.
