Starting around the beginning of last year, I haven't been very responsible. This is definitely a topic I don't want to talk to anyone else about because I don't want to argue with them and be judged by them. I need to get over that fear.

Anyways, what's particularly important to me is my recent habits. I have a strong urge to avoid doing my assignments and to procrastinate them, almost as if it's somehow a best practice. Of course, I do hate rushing to do things, and there are good times and bad times to do things. I know that very well, and I often know when it's good time to do things. The problem is I have been not doing things when those good times come lately. In fact, I've been oddly afraid of being productive.

I think the demon I'm struggling with might just be procrastination, but the fear aspect of it and the pride I get from not doing anything productive at all makes me feel like maybe it should be called something else. Some people who procrastinate are doing other productive things, while I'm just watching dumb videos and playing dumb games.

The most irritating thing about all of this is that I feel horrible because there are so many cool things I want to do and I haven't done any of them. But, that's not the most irritating part. Even not getting my homework done is not the most irritating part. The worst part of all of this is me staying up late at night to no benefit and not getting enough sleep because I have so many 8:00 classes. I like the 8:00 classes, so I'm not saying I want to change my schedule. If anything, having to wake up early in the morning gives me a good reason to actually be responsible. I think I'll keep waking up at 5:30, even on Saturdays, even though I am not a morning person. I might change this schedule a bit in the future, but it seems like one way to encourage myself to have be responsible with my time. I'll say: not getting enough sleep is unbearable for me. I know all the symptoms and will gladly disagree with any list of symptoms that strays much from my anecdotal observations.

In fact, I'd like to list the symtoms of not getting enough sleep that I've experienced:
* I can't think straight. Thoughts are harder to form, and I can't do abstract thinking very well. If I try to imagine abstract things in my head they are more loose and much harder to think about.
* My vocabulary is effectively smaller. I can't (as easily) find the right words to use to communicate my ideas.
* I can't solve new problems in creative ways. I can memorize new solutions and use existing solutions, but my creativity is rather limited.
* Another symptom is that I can't really feel as much. I can still have emotional highs and lows, but they are less frequent, and I just don't care about things as much. It's also harder and more exhausting to make myself feel anything.
* An obvious symptom is that I have to fight to keep myself awake. This means I'm constantly in a fight-or-flight state until I finally give in to sleep.
* And finally, being in a fight-or-flight state constantly and not feeling as emotional is incredibly irritating. I'm quite disppointed in myself right now for not going to bed at a good time. The worst part is once it gets late, I make up excuses to stay up longer. Sorry, "got stuff to do" Simon, but "need to sleep right now" Simon has had enough. I almost don't care what reason there is for staying awake, sleep is my new number 1 priority.

I've been growing more and more upset at myself about this subject for a few months now. But this is it though. Previously, my subconscious was working on some stuff, so at least it wasn't impeded by me being irresposible or sleepy. It has its own schedule anyways. And I **have** learned a lot from all of this.

So it all ends us now! No more! I'm going to do my best to minimize time wasted. I'll start by not watching YouTube! I can tell from the unpleasant feeling that thought gives me that the urge to watch YouTube anyways is really strong. If the urge is strong, then my loathing towards it will be strong too! I refuse to lose to something I can beat with brute force. I'm an angry brute at heart afterall! I'd feel insulted if my anger couldn't at least do something good for me here. Although I know I need to keep my feelings under wraps and I plan on thinking about this in a calm manner. I'll stay determined and keep a firm hold on my desires.

If you're Christian, you might want to mention that I should ask God for help. Well, I'm already asking for his help, but I feel very responsible for this demon I'm being troubled with. I'll do my best to take responsibility and fight it when I can.

Although, at this point, it's quite clear that I will really need God's help a lot.

Yeah, not getting enough sleep really is having an effect on me. The voices in my head have gotten louder and I hear my own thoughts more coherently, but I think those are actually the result of my improved brain structure and fusing with my origin (what I described in my March 7 entry).

But right now, since I'm sleepy, I can see what's going in my subconscious, and it's pretty fascinating. I can even poke at it to actually make myself feel something, and it's one of the few ways I can feel anything (emotionally) while in this sleepy state. It seems I can also interact with some of my subconsciouses thoughts. It's currently thinking about naughty things in some abstract way that doesn't come off as naughty. It seems I can put other things in its thoughts if I want. I'll have to start experimenting with this new ability and see what kind of use I can get out of it. If I try to force it to do something it makes me feel a wave of sleepiness. While inserting thoughts seems to not make me as sleepy. Very interesting. If I can use this while fully conscious it might make a great tool. I know my subconscious is not very busy right now, so maybe that it part of the reason why I can interact with it. Or perhaps this is just a new ability I have developed. I think the latter is more likely to be the case.

In any case, I have a lot to explore there. My immediate thought is to use my subconscious to train myself to not be so irresponsible and watch useless videos and stuff.
