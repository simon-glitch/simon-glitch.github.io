Also, apparently you can commit to GitHub while offline. It just stores the data on your computer and then does the commit when you click "sync changes". I guess that's why you always need to sync the changes. Good thing I've *been* clicking it thoughtlessly every time I use the page.

# Files I'm deleting on my computer
Microsoft Office takes up 3.34 GB of storage space on my computer.
I also found Visual Studio's useless 4.93 GB folder.
