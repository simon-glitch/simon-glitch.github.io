# Back to my project
I actually got back to working on my lemour programming language project today. However, I am working offline. That means I am making these edits at my (paternal) grandpa's house.

# GitHub Commits while offline
Also, apparently you can commit to GitHub while offline. It just stores the data on your computer and then does the commit when you click "sync changes". I guess that's why you always need to sync the changes. Good thing I've *been* clicking it thoughtlessly every time I use the page.

# Files I'm deleting on my computer
Microsoft Office takes up 3.34 GB of storage space on my computer.
I also found Visual Studio's useless 4.93 GB folder.
