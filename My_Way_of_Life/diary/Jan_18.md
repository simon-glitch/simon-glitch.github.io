# Levels of thinking
I keep noticing different places where a {"levels of thinking" or "levels or comprehension"}-style approach might be optimal. I saw this chart called "levels of thinking", which is based on decades of research, and I also watched this video by hoemath (a youtuber) explaining te chart. After seeing it, I have come to believe that the chart is not perfect and doesn't properly describe the way the human mind works, but it is still very helpful with its concept of social / behavioral layers.

For example, if you wanna look at the causes of a person's behavioral issues, levels of thinking can help you break down each cause and effect, eventually helping you find an ultimate cause of the problem and an ultimate solution.
