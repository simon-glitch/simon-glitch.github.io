# Levels of thinking
I keep noticing different places where a {"levels of thinking" or "levels or comprehension"}-style approach might be optimal. I saw this chart called "levels of thinking", which is based on decades of research, and I also watched this video by hoemath (a youtuber) explaining te chart. After seeing it, I have come to believe that the chart is not perfect and doesn't properly describe the way the human mind works, but it is still very helpful with its concept of social / behavioral layers.

For example, if you wanna look at the causes of a person's behavioral issues, levels of thinking can help you break down each cause and effect, eventually helping you find an ultimate cause of the problem and an ultimate solution.

## So?
I plan to start using this "levels" approach more in my personal essays here on GitHub. I want to explore some topics and think about them analytically. Maybe I can look at some famous (or interesting) researchable problems and try to use "levels" to solve them. In fact, I should write an essay (I'll do it tomorrow) to define what these "levels" are and how I can use them as a problem-solving strategy.

# Is this part of my schedule now?
I said in the README that I have "no intent" on making this diary a part of my daily routine. However, I will try to write something in here every day. I have lots of thoughts (and feelings) that I feel are worthwhile enough to mention (or to at least clarify to myself). However, there really isn't much to put in here. For example, right now I really am just verbalizing my thoughts, without much point beyond saying that I'm doing it. I guess I just feel like getting this ... tension out of my system.
