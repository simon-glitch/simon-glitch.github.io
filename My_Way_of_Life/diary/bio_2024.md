> I was really careful writing this, because I don't want to be too dishonest. Sometimes, I act immature, because resisting my instincts every second of the day is difficult, and I have a lot of energy that is just hard to contain. However, I seem to do a good enough job at reserving all of my immature behavior and inappopriate thoughts for when I am at home, because almost no one has ever noticed them.

Yeah bro, I think there are some problems with what your wrote here.

I feel really confident all the time, and I like to believe that I can probably learn to do just about anything as well as the average person, but I am really weird, and certain tasks turn out to be far more difficult for me than my father expects them to be. I'm pretty sure other people have also noticed that sometimes I can overthink things or even just not understand the idea they are trying to communicate, and that causes issues. I really hope other people won't get upset at me, because it's really not my fault. I can't have perfect understanding all the time. I don't understand how other people do so well.
