# Hi
This is a tutorial, to help you make a game with Chiwang.

I really hope you understand this.

# Note
This tutorial is only for any developer who wants to use the engine as a JavaScript library. This means you will have to write a script in JavaScript.

~~If you want to use the Chiwi language instead, see [`./chiwi/intro.md`](./chiwi/intro.md).~~
* *The Chiwi interpreter has not been developed yet, so you will have to write your game script in JavaScript.*
* *Sorry.*

# Installation
First, make sure you can use Chiwang. You can do this in 2 ways:
* **1:** just add this script to your webpage
    * `<script src="https://simon-glitch.github.io/2024/chiwang/docs/intro.md"></script>`
* **2:** download the `./src` folder from this repository
    * and then add the engine's script to your webpage
    * it should look like this:
    * `<script src="./src/engine.js"></script>`
    * the `.` is whatever folder you put the engine in
    * make sure to keep your files organized so you'll know where that is
    * it might help to use an absolute URL

# Starter example
This example explains a lot of things that can be found throughout the documentation.

See [Example 1](./example_1.md).

# WIP: TBA
More examples need to be added here. This project is just a work in progress (WIP).

# Meta note
I wrote this tutorial to be much less formal, while the [README](../README.md) is written to be much more formal. I hope that doesn't upset anyone.

# Closing words
This library lets you do a lot more, but you can just use the examples as a way to get started.
