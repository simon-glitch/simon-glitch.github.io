# Time to ramble!
(this will all go in the commit message)

all of the scripts have wrapper functions because JavaScript puts const and let variables on a shared scope across scripts, but not in the window (so it's like a semi-global scope)

There is only 1 commit message here because I uninstalled Git when I had mistakenly thought there were multiple instances of it on my system and that the version I had uninstalled was just an extra version. I'm such a fool when it comes to installing things in particular.

i really would have liked to have written individual commit messages for each part of this project, LOL

i even wrote a crazy md file about my writing styles; oh boy writing sure is a pretty complex field of study!

i think im slowly figuring out how my dad's dyslexia might work; my theory is that he speaks faster than he can come up with the synonyms / related words for what he's saying; however, that brings a new question to mind: why have i been having such a hard time coming up with synonyms / related words lately?

the more i think about it, the more i feel like i have the answer within my somewhere

now that i think about it, there really is no hard limit to how long a commit message can get, is there?

ah, i sure am glad that reinstalling Git seems to have just worked; it's nice to see those pretty green colors return
