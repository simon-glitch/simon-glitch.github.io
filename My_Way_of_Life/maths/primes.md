
 1737, the connection between the zeta function and prime numbers was discovered by Euler, who proved the identity

sum {n=1 to infinity} of {1/n^2} = product {p in primes} of {1/(1-p^(-s))}

Where, by definition, the analytic continuation of the left hand side is Î¶(s); and the infinite product on the right hand side extends over all prime numbers p (such expressions are called Euler products).

I am wondering though, which sets of primes satisfy the identity above?
* Real Primes do, obviously
* But what about Guassian Primes?
* What about Matrix Primes? (Real matrices composed of integers which don't break down into other matrices composed of primes)
* What about Guassian Matrix Primes (Complex matrices which are prime like the other ones)
