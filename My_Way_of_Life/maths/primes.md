
 1737, the connection between the zeta function and prime numbers was discovered by Euler, who proved the identity


\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n^{s}}}=\prod _{p{\text{ prime}}}{\frac {1}{1-p^{-s}}},
where, by definition, the left hand side is Î¶(s) and the infinite product on the right hand side extends over all prime numbers p (such expressions are called Euler products):
