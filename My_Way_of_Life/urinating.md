I tend to be different than other people, in so many little ways. My penis and how I urinate is definitely no exception.

I often get an erection when I need to urinate. This is because the weight of the full bladder presses down on the muscle used to performing the erection. The weight of the full bladder also seems to make my nerves a bit more sensitive.

I actually rarely wake up with morning wood (an erection when I wake up). I think this is because I am only prone to getting hard when I need to urinate, and I am good at staying still while asleep. I almost always do have to urinate when I wake up. So, on the days when I roll around in bed before waking up, I tend to be rock hard. Every other day though, I am so relaxed (not just down below, but in general) that I end up being completely soft (no erection at all).

When I am out in public, 90% of erections are caused by a full bladder (**plus** a small amount of stimulation). When I am at home, only 35% of erections are caused by a full bladded. The other main causes are intentional fondling, and provocative thoughts.
* I tend to fiddle with my penis a lot. Only 1/4 of the time I am trying to properly masturbate. A lot of the time, I just want to get hard, because the hard on just feels really good (on its own).
* I also have a lot of provocative thoughts. The more intense ones sometimes cause an erection. However, most of the time, I need physical stimulation.

Here is a chart to summarize:
```
| CAUSES           |  at home | in public | in school |
| full bladder     |      35% |       90% |       80% |
| my fondling      |      45% |        6% |        8% |
| naughty thoughts |      20% |        4% |       12% |
```

I should also clarify, the full bladder usually causes an erection when I receive some physical stimulation. However, even a small bump of press is usually enough with a full bladder. Sometimes it is really hard to keep myself from getting hard.

I don't have stuff like "pretty women" on the chart, because a woman being pretty (on its own) does not get me hard. Me having naught thoughts about a pretty woman **can** get me hard though. And still, I almost always need physical stimulation. However, talking to woman that I am really attracted to can get my heart racing (but I just don't get hard).

## Meta Comment
This document almost falls under the `provocative thoughts` category, since I am having a lot of provocative thoughts. However, writing this is not giving me a hard on. I did start writing this because I got a hard on and that reminded me of how the causes of my erections are kinda weird.

## Turned On
Being turned on is a prerequisite to getting hard for me. I guess this is is why getting hard is so difficult for me, to be honest. I have to be turned on first. Now, to be fair, a lot of things turn me on. Seeing provocative images (i.e. porn) works really well, but I prefer other sources. I actually enjoy being turned on, and I find images to be a lame way to get turned on. Thus, I genuinely do seek other methods. If I had a girlfriend, my 2 goals with the relationship would be: 1, get her to appreciate me; and 2, get turned on by her. I simply want to be turned on; I don't *necessarily* want to **do** anything sexual; my feelings of being turned on are one of my top priorities!

So, what actually turns me on? Oh, lots of things do. Here is a list:
* intelligence
* confidence
* strength
* compassion
* getting hard - it's hard to get hard when I am not very turned on, but getting hard definitely helps me feel more turned on; I often fondle my penis in order to get hard, just to make myself feel more turned on!

Ok, so, basically, admirable personality traits are what turns me on. Yup, I really see women for their personality traits. A woman looking good (or being attractive) only does one thing: make me pay more attention to her. If a beautiful woman has admirable personality traits, I will be more likely to look for them and will them earlier. Obvsiously, it follows that an ugly woman is noot much worse than a pretty woman. The pretty woman is only given an initial attention bias. I don't actually value pretty women any more than less pretty women. However, I am still against ugliness, **when** it means that the woman is not healthy. So, I am truly attracted to healthy women with good personality traits.

In order to be turned on in real time (live time), I need to see an action that reflects an admirable personality trait. For example, watching someone win an interesting argument might turn me on.
