## Definition

{{quote| Mindfulness is commonly defined as the awareness that arises when paying attention to the present moment nonjudgmentally. In 1881, the English scholar Rhys Davids translated the word mindfulness from the Pali word sati found in Buddhist texts, which meant â€œmemory, recollection, calling-to-mind, being-aware-of, certain specified facts" but which has also been described as "lucid awareness" or "bare attention." The terms mindfulness and meditation are increasingly conflated. General integrative practices (e.g., visualization, yoga) are often described as "mindfulness" in public discourse, diluting the word's meaning. Importantly, not all meditation is mindfulness and not all mindfulness is meditation. Meditation is a practice that self-regulates the body and mind by engaging a specific attentional set. In mindfulness meditation (MM), the practice is to pay attention to present-moment experience with an orientation of curiosity, openness, acceptance, nonreactivity, and nonjudgment. }}
