I know you don't care, but I need to type this paragraph. Part of me has given up on this assignment, and I don't really understand why. I'm going to try fighting it for now, but the speech / paper might turn out to be really low quality by the time I am done with it. I couldn't find a speech topic that doesn't make me feel like shutting down, so I guess I will just have to bite the bullet and ignore my subconscious's request to shut down and run away. I really don't understand this feeling of severe irrational fear, but I guess I just have to cope with it. Regardless of me coing or not coping, I am officiall unsure about whether I can do this assignment and unsure about whether I should do it. Maybe you don't like to hear that my own emotions are plaguing me this way, but they are. I am dealing with this, but it seems its going to take about 1 week or 2 for them to stop bugging me. And "no", I am not going to incorporate these issues of my own personal struggling into the essay. This paragraph is the best explanation I even have for them, and this paragraph would obviously feel and sound horrible in the paper. Quite literally, these words, and these ones exactly, are the best way I can explain how I feel right now.

I guess you would call the previous paragraph "rumination".

Some people would say that mindfulness has "crept into mainstream culture".[3] In fact, the number of articles in the WoS about mindfulness has grown exponentially over time since around 2006.[4 # Results] The reason mindfulness is so releavant is its benefits and scientific credibility. Mindfulness improves attention, improves focus, and helps the subject better respond to the subject's emotions.[2] Studies also suggest that mindfulness promotes empathy.[2]

## Definition

{{quote| Mindfulness is commonly defined as the awareness that arises when paying attention to the present moment nonjudgmentally. In 1881, the English scholar Rhys Davids translated the word mindfulness from the Pali word sati found in Buddhist texts, which meant â€œmemory, recollection, calling-to-mind, being-aware-of, certain specified facts" but which has also been described as "lucid awareness" or "bare attention." The terms mindfulness and meditation are increasingly conflated. General integrative practices (e.g., visualization, yoga) are often described as "mindfulness" in public discourse, diluting the word's meaning. Importantly, not all meditation is mindfulness and not all mindfulness is meditation. Meditation is a practice that self-regulates the body and mind by engaging a specific attentional set. In mindfulness meditation (MM), the practice is to pay attention to present-moment experience with an orientation of curiosity, openness, acceptance, nonreactivity, and nonjudgment. }} [1]

In summary, mindfulness is a state of the subject being aware of the subject's personal experiences without *judgement*.[1, 2]

## Conflation with meditation
Mindfulness is often confused with meditation, and both terms have become increasingly conflated.[1 # MINDFULNESS AND MBIs] Furthermore, there are many informal articles have "pervated" (tainted) the literature around mindfulness.[5 # Abstract] In spite of these issues, there is a lot of good research on mindfulness (source [1] is an example), and it has been proven to be useful.

To be clear,  ~"Meditation is the practice of regulating the mind, by engaging in a specific set of attention"~.[1 # MINDFULNESS AND MBIs]

Mindfulness and meditation, although different, can be combined into one activity: Mindfulness meditation (MM). ~"MM is the practice paying attention to the present experience with an emphasis on being curious, opennes, acceptant, nonreactive, and nonjudgmental"~.[1 # MINDFULNESS AND MBIs]
