# Anger
## Meta
This is a persuasive essay for COMM101 class, but I affirm that everything I say here is what I believe to be true.

## Essay
Anger is the strongest demon, against me. I struggled throughout my childhood, not knowing that my anger caused most of my unhappiness and the problems I faced. However, life is better now, because when I hit puberty I took the time to prioritize controlling my anger now.

Recently, I noticed my anger was present in places in my mind which I had believed to be calm and anger free. With this recent noticement, I have been working on improving my patience and brightening my overall mindset on my life. However, the anger is always there, burning as a hot and deadly fire.

### Credibility
If you don't already trust me, please just don't read this. I don't want to manipulate anyone.

### Got a point?
Of course there's a point to this essay! Let's look for it.

First, I need to convince you that being angry is never a good idea.

### Don't let your emotions control you
#### Simple version
As humans, each of us assosciates every emotion with a want. If one is afriad, one wants to escape the source of the fear, remove the source, or prevent the source from being able to continue existing. Anger typically implies the latter case: anger tells one that one need to remove something from existence, by any means necessary. Anger is an inherently hateful emotion, because it will do whatever it takes to elimate whatever it flags as the source or reason for the anger being present. For me, this is not a rational or practical response, since my anger returns every 1 to 2 minutes with no need for a source or target.

#### Contradicting wants
The "want" of an emotion can easily contradict itself, especially anger. Anger occurs in response to troublesome problems with the environment, and anger tells you to destroy parts of the environment to address this. This method is bad, since the enivornment ends up damaged and loses many of its good qualities as a result.

#### Delay
*Issue: This is a secondary problem.*

Reacting to an emotion like it has a want or desire is a bad idea, even when there is a good justification behind the emotion. Emotions can not think or perform logic. We have to pull on our knowledge, memory, and understanding to give our emotions meaning and respond to them. Studies show that when an emotion, like fear, is caused by a stimulus, such as a lion, the physical response precedes felt emotions. Emotions naturally take time to acquire in response to the environment. Therefore, you should make sure to take some time to decide your actions in response to actions.
