## Types of emotion
Chemical emotion
* lasts for 3 to 5 minutes, minimum; can't really flee
* an undenable feeling that I feel does not need explanation or proof of its existence; it is there, because I can feel it in my inner being
* does not require a thought in order to be felt, but can occur in response to a triggering thought
* if you can think about it and figure out what caused it, then it becomes an attached emotion
* list:
  * anger
    * makes me take too many shortcuts in my thought process and gives me tunnel vision; often times this results in me being upset at myself of the mistakes I made while I was angry
  * sadness
    * I actually like this feeling, probably because I feel it so rarely; I usually get a strong dopamine hit after being sad for a few minutes
  * fear
    * fear drastically reduces my performance; if I have a reason to be afraid, I shouldn't be afraid because the fear makes my thought process and motor control less accurate and therefore makes me less able to optimally escape the danger (or reduce the risk) that caused the fear
  * joy
    * contentment is a composite emotion, and happiness is a mental state 
  * nostalgia
    * this feeling occurs whenever I remember stuff that feels weird important or relevant
    * many people don't realize how much attachment (i.e. affection) this emotion can cause
      * affection is an attached emotion, which I will argue requires nostalgia in order to be genuine
      * love is a mental state, not an emotion
  * inverse nostalgia
    * I'm not sure if this one exists; maybe I've never felt it before
  * dominance
    * I didn't realize this existed until about 7 months ago
    * the feeling I get when I am dominating
    * does not cause me to want to dominate
    * I don't experience this unless I completely dominate something and acknowledge the victory, with an emphasis on feeling like I accomplished something meaningful by winning
  * compliance
    * I didn't realize this existed until about 7 months ago
    * AKA passiveness / submission
    * the feeling I get when I am complying or cooperating
    * does not cause me to want to comply
    * I don't experience this unless I comply with something I initially was against and acknowledge the validity of what I'm compliy with, with an emphasis on feeling like I accomplished something meaningful by complying and that I am not just being polite
  * 2 others
    * I don't know what they are or what causes them
    * they seem similar to nostalgia, but ... that doesn't quite describe them
    * they are just WEIRD feelings that I used to feel when I was younger; I feel composite nostalgia about remembering experiencing these emotions, but the emotions themselves never were nostalgia to begin with
  * excitement
    * anger might just be excitement + fear, but I'm not sure
    * excitment often feels more physical, or maybe like it is a mental state of wanting something, but I believe there is a mental equivalent
    * I'm not sure which feelings are chemical excitement and which ones are other mental states, but I am actively trying to figure it out

Attached emotion
* can last for any amount of time, as long as the attached object or event stays attached and you still have the inclination to feel the chemical emotion in relation to the object or event
* a checmial emotion attached to a physical object or event
* examples: "that picture is ugly", "that concert was fun", "the clown scared me", "I am angry at you"
* requires the object or event to be named, labeled, referenced, or thought of in order to be attached
* the attached object or event is usually the cause of the chemical emotion

Composite emotion
* can be argued against and dismissed
* not to be confused with feeling (i.e. hypothesis), like: "I feel appreciated." (hypothesis: I am appreciated, as far as I define the word, even if someone else disagrees with my hypothesis or definition)
* composed of an outer emotion and an inner thought or emotion; the inner thought or emotion is essentially placed inside the outer emotion
* examples: "I am happy that I know [something]", "I am worried that I will become angry if [situation happens]", "I am sorry for being rude to you earlier", "I am disappointed in him for overreacting to his anger earlier"
