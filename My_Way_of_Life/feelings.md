## My goal with this document
I hope {I can ascertain a more clear and systematic understanding of my various feelings,} by writing this. We will see though XD!


## (or Emotions - they are the same thing)

I have identified multiple (TODO: count) types of emotions (just within myself). So, I'll list them here and now. We have:
* chemical emotions
* intellectual *(pure thought)* emotions
* hypothoses *(sometimes confused for opinions, due to the word judgment being used to refer to all of {opinions, hypothoses, and opinionated hypothoses})*
* opinions *(how one thinks the world should be)*

### Define [chemical emotions]
Chemical emotions are a lot like resources. I make an active effort to control and manage these like sparse resources. One of my goals is to make the most use that I can out of these.

The chemical emotions are:
* joy (delight)
* sorrow
* fear
* disgust
* nostalgia (and deja vu)


### Define [intellectual emotions]
Intellectual emotions always seem to be some kind of strange phenomenon. Or at least, that is often what I end up thinking when (while & after) I experience them.

### Define [hypothoses]


### Define [opinions]
(deicisions of facts about how things should be)
