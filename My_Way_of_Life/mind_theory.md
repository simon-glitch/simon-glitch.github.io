
I got this theory on the human mind.
The core idea is that the mind is made of 5 parts (or substances):
* knowledge
* emotion
* thought
* awareness
* perspective

These parts can be "incurred" on each other and themselves.
* you can think about thinking
* you can know what you know (basically be sure of your knowledge)
* you can be aware of your own awareness
* you can have a perspective on why a perspective is relevant
* you can have emotions which are responses to previous emotions (like feeling happy about feeling sad earlier because your feeling sad helped you realize a problem or something)

# School and the weakness of Knowledge
The theory explains why school is essentially useless.

And of the 5 categories, knowledge is the weakest. An animal has knowledge, but it's not really aware of it (since the animal is not "self aware").
* Knowledge can be ascertained through mere experience and memorization. There is almost no inherent developement value to it.

Essentially, knowledge is only relevant to whatever field it is knowledge in. And so, it's a lot less impactful than the other 4 parts of the human mind. 
* The other parts, obviously, are useful in lots of different contexts and throughout your every day life. Thus, they are oftentimes more relevant than knowledge.
* Schools almost exclusively focus on offering knowledge to students. Of course, a teacher might help students with their emotions, or might help them improve their perspective, or might give a student something interesting to think about; but, the school as an organization has no concern for that, and a teacher has to spend a lot of extra time and energy to do those extra things.
* Thus, school is heavily weighted in the favor of knowledge.

If the student wants to develop their brain in the other categories, that's almost solely the student's responsibility. The student will have to make a person, individual effort towards improving themself in that way.
* Finally, due to the school having a different goal than the student (the student aims to improve in all 5 categories, while the school only cares about 1), the school lacks "empathy" for the student and is not very relevant in the big picture (as far as the student sees things). The economy might be happy that the student has the knowledge that's required to perform in high-skill jobs, but that's not everything to the student. Also, high-skill jobs actually require thinking skills, self-awareness, and emotional development. So, the people who get high-skill and high-pay jobs often have to do a lot of individual development on their own ON TOP OF getting properly educated by the school (or by themselves).
