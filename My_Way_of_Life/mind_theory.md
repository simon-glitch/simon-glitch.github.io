
I got this theory on the human mind.
The core idea is that the mind is made of 5 parts (or substances):
* knowledge
* emotion
* thought
* awareness
* perspective

These parts can be "incurred" on each other and themselves.
* you can think about thinking
* you can know what you know (basically be sure of your knowledge)
* you can be aware of your own awareness
* you can have a perspective on why a perspective is relevant
* you can have emotions which are responses to previous emotions (like feeling happy about feeling sad earlier because your feeling sad helped you realize a problem or something)

## School and the weakness of Knowledge
The theory explains why school is essentially useless.

And of the 5 categories, knowledge is the weakest. An animal has knowledge, but it's not really aware of it (since the animal is not "self aware").
* Knowledge can be ascertained through mere experience and memorization. There is almost no inherent developement value to it.

Essentially, knowledge is only relevant to whatever field it is knowledge in. And so, it's a lot less impactful than the other 4 parts of the human mind. 
* The other parts, obviously, are useful in lots of different contexts and throughout your every day life. Thus, they are oftentimes more relevant than knowledge.
* Schools almost exclusively focus on offering knowledge to students. Of course, a teacher might help students with their emotions, or might help them improve their perspective, or might give a student something interesting to think about; but, the school as an organization has no concern for that, and a teacher has to spend a lot of extra time and energy to do those extra things.
* Thus, school is heavily weighted in the favor of knowledge.

If the student wants to develop their brain in the other categories, that's almost solely the student's responsibility. The student will have to make a person, individual effort towards improving themself in that way.
* Finally, due to the school having a different goal than the student (the student aims to improve in all 5 categories, while the school only cares about 1), the school lacks "empathy" for the student and is not very relevant in the big picture (as far as the student sees things). The economy might be happy that the student has the knowledge that's required to perform in high-skill jobs, but that's not everything to the student. Also, high-skill jobs actually require thinking skills, self-awareness, and emotional development. So, the people who get high-skill and high-pay jobs often have to do a lot of individual development on their own ON TOP OF getting properly educated by the school (or by themselves).

# The Subconscious
Consciousness is a weird thing to all of us. Philosophers (and psychologists) have been spending millenia trying to define what it is, or at least parts of what it is.

I won't define consciousness in a fundamental way, but I will describe the behavior I have observed with my own here. This description stands as another theory, on top of the theory from earlier in this document.

## Consciousness as a Form of Perspective
The human brain can contain multiple consciousnesses, but only one can be active at a time. The inactive ones will remain highly functional as subconscious threads. All of the subconscious threads are handled by a single subconscious controller (referred to as "the subconscious"). This controller is not very communicative with the active conscious on its own. The controller uses the subconscious threads as communication relays instead of talking to the active conscious on its own.

Each consciousness, regardless of whether its a subconscious thread or the active consciousness, is represented by a perspective. This perspective is best described as a philosophical awareness of reality. Each consciousness can have a very different decision making mindset. As we grow as human beings, we add new consciousnesses, which are fine tuned to these "perspectives". This allows us to better empathize with other people, and do things like understanding cultures other than our own.

### Things not in the Consciousness
Each consciousness doesn't have certain things. For example, they don't each have their own knowledge, skills, or opinions. Knowledge is globally accessible to every part of the brain. This is why the subconscious can construct vivid and sometimes coherent dreams. Opinions are actually encoded as knoweldge. A humble person adds knowledge about their knowledge to remind themself which knowledge is opinions and which knowledge is (supposedly) fact.

Skills are created through patterns on how to perform operations in decision making. Some of these operations are actually dependant on perspective. Therefore, consciousnesses can have some skill. However, more of these "operations" don't depend on perspective. Therefore, most skill is not stored in the "consciousnesses" (I have defined them).
