For much of my childhood, I was ruled by fear. I still have many fears that hold me back. I don't want to drop my fears, because I know there are situations where they keep me safe. So, I am working on improving my control over when my fears trigger and improving my understanding of when my fears are valid.

Even now, I am controlled by a fear-based empathy. I try to avoid talking to strangers, because I am afraid they might become irritated. My justification behind this fear is that my dad often gets irritated when I decide to talk to him about certain topics. Basically, my dad has no patience nor appreciation for any of my hobbies. Also, 80% of the time when I do want to talk to someone, it is so I can tell them about one of my random side thoughts. My dad hates 99.9999% of my random side thoughts and has absolutely 0 patience for them. I fear that other people might be irritated **some** of my random side thoughts, and might have little patience for them. However, I do know that other people will probably be more accepting and patient than my dad. Nonetheless, I try to be considerate, and avoid potentially wasting other people's time.

## Isolated?
As the AI puts it: I have chosen to isloate myself.

## It's a hybrid
My problem is a weird hybrid between fear and empathy. My solution is a weird hybrid between courage and cowardice.
