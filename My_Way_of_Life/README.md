# My Way of Life
## What this project is
I have decided to write down some of my deeper thoughts and opinions, and record the way I see the world. In this project, I will descibe my mentality, my way of life, my religious beliefs, my life goals, and the way I think.

Hopefully, I will identify many personal flaws during this project, and find a way to address them. I am always looking to improve.

The first thing I would love to write about is my beliefs about God. Noone else seems capable of hearing the holy spirit like I am. It seems that other people also have a completely wrong conception of what the afterlife is like.

### A diary?
This whole folder / project is a lot like a diary. There is also a diary folder. The diary folder describes chronological events and other things having to do with the timeline of my life.

Everything else is a bunch of my thoughts and opinions, which evolve over time, rather than occuring (or existing) at a specific point in time.
