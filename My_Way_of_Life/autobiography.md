# Professor's Comments
Recently (I think it started on around Nov/1/2023) my philosophy professor has been calling some of my comments "autobiography". He is like "is this more autobiography, Simon?"

I am not exactly sure how to take this XD. But yeah, a lot of my comments are very profound expressions of my thoughts and beliefs. A lot of my thoughts are extremely radical and unique. Thus, a lot of the things that I say, **during regular communication** are appropriate text content for an autobiography.

**In fact,** this folder (`My_Way_of_Life`) is meant to be an autobiography. I guess I will try to write something in here every day. I just have so many thoughts though, and I just don't know what to right. I suppose I will just have to find the courage within me to write **something** or another every day. Don't worry Simon: GitHub will remember everything you write. If you write anything weird or confusing, you can correct it and explain it later.
