This past year has been really interesting. I am not the same person now that I was a year ago. In fact, I have changed more in this past year than I did throughout my entire childhood. In about August, 2022, I decided to master my subconscious. I got this idea because I kept heating other people complain that they have no control over their subconscious.

This process started with just identifying my subconscious. This was easier than you would think, for me, since my brain is built on a search-based system. I can essentially search for subconscious activity, read information about changes that were made during prior subconscious activity, and change parameters for future subconscious activity. Some people would hear or read this explanation, and then reject it; they would say "you are full of shit", and "you must be really cocky if you think you can just do that!". I know it is hard to believe, but I really can do this with my subconscious.

# Awareness
When I first looked for my subconscious, I just got a vague feeling that "something is in there". As I continued searching, which took weeks, I started to recognize the parts and pieces and identify how they work. So, how does it work then?
* Well, the subconscious works just like the conscious (surprisingly enough), but with one small difference:
    * the subconscious uses almost none of the restrictions and restrictive rules that the conscious uses.

Dreams are the same as conscious imagining, and instinctive thoughts are the same as thoughtful decision making. The only difference is that dreams happen with no restrictions or rules. Instinctive thoughts are dangerous because they look like regular thoughts, but they are less logical, due to the lack of rules that are usually applied to conscious thoughts.

This might sound strange, but being able to identify (and control, *to some degree*) my subconscious does not solve all of my problems. I am still human and still have many flaws. Seeing and controlling my subconscious is simply a skill that I can use to help with tasks.

# Seeing vs Controlling
Just seeing the subconscious is really helpful, due to the search based design of my consciousness.

## Just Seeing
My whole life, all of my thoughts have worked in much the same way. My thought process is like an event stack (which is a concept from programming). I can trace a thought to where it came from, since most thoughts have many markers to describe where they came from. My mind works this way because {explaining **why** things are the way they are} is my number 1 priority. I still get lost in though though, since I have my limits, and it would be very cumbersome to keep a perfect memory of every small thought I have.

So, what do we mean by **every** thought? Aren't thoughts supposed to be continuous? How can you discretely attach information to them? Well, believe it or not, thoughts are actually not continuous. Thoughts feel continuous because the parts of the brain to not work at a consistent speed. Furthermore, you can not be aware of the discreteness of our own awareness, because you can not divide a moment of your awareness into smaller pieces of time. Your awareness comes to you "as is". Thus, you can't really extract more stuff from "between the lines". If you don't understand what I am trying to say, I'm sorry: I just can't really explain it without giving you math equations and telling you to just trust me.
