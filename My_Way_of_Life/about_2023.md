This past year has been really interesting. I am not the same person now that I was a year ago. In fact, I have changed more in this past year than I did throughout my entire childhood. In about August, 2022, I decided to master my subconscious. I got this idea because I kept heating other people complain that they have no control over their subconscious.

This process started with just identifying my subconscious. This was easier than you would think, for me, since my brain is built on a search-based system. I can essentially search for subconscious activity, read information about changes that were made during prior subconscious activity, and change parameters for future subconscious activity. Some people would hear or read this explanation, and then reject it; they would say "you are full of shit", and "you must be really cocky if you think you can just do that!". I know it is hard to believe, but I really can do this with my subconscious.

# Awareness
When I first looked for my subconscious, I just got a vague feeling that "something is in there". As I continued searching, which took weeks, I started to recognize the parts and pieces and identify how they work. So, how does it work then?
* Well, the subconscious works just like the conscious (surprisingly enough), but with one small difference:
    * the subconscious uses almost none of the restrictions and restrictive rules that the conscious uses.

Dreams are the same as conscious imagining, and instinctive thoughts are the same as thoughtful decision making. The only difference is that dreams happen with no restrictions or rules. Instinctive thoughts are dangerous because they look like regular thoughts, but they are less logical, due to the lack of rules that are usually applied to conscious thoughts.

This might sound strange, but being able to identify (and control, *to some degree*) my subconscious does not solve all of my problems. I am still human and still have many flaws. Seeing and controlling my subconscious is simply a skill that I can use to help with tasks.

# Seeing vs Controlling
Just seeing the subconscious is really helpful, due to the search based design of my consciousness.

## Just Seeing
My whole life, all of my thoughts have worked in much the same way. My thought process is like an event stack (which is a concept from programming). I can trace a thought to where it came from, since most thoughts have many markers to describe where they came from. My mind works this way because {explaining **why** things are the way they are} is my number 1 priority. I still get lost in though though, since I have my limits, and it would be very cumbersome to keep a perfect memory of every small thought I have.

So, what do we mean by **every** thought? Aren't thoughts supposed to be continuous? How can you discretely attach information to them? Well, believe it or not, thoughts are actually not continuous. Thoughts feel continuous because the parts of the brain to not work at a consistent speed. Furthermore, you can not be aware of the discreteness of our own awareness, because you can not divide a moment of your awareness into smaller pieces of time. Your awareness comes to you "as is". Thus, you can't really extract more stuff from "between the lines". If you don't understand what I am trying to say, I'm sorry: I just can't really explain it without giving you math equations and telling you to just trust me.

### So thoughts always feel continuous?
Well, yes. Your thought process (as a whole) should always feel continuous. Sometimes you might feel a hiccup here or there, and then the hiccup might feel discrete.

### How do break up thoughts inot discrete chunks?
Well, it's simpler than you would think. All of my thoughts are composed of objects with attached details. When I say object, I mean an abstract object in my brain. My consciousness is able to pass around and move abstract (conceptual) objects. These objects are used for describing all possible thoughts and ideas. Many feelings are also partially constituted by these objects. These objects are discete, and I can read information on them, almost as if I am asking them questions. The questions I can ask them are:
* where have you been? (object gives a small stack trace of which objects it has interacted with recently)
* what names do you have?
* which classifications do you have? (object lists sets that is an element within)
* which objects are you neighbors with? (object lists its neighbors, and the weights of correlation between it and its neighbors)

Now, I should clarify: this system is not perfect. The way I perceive objects is highly relativistic (subjective). This means that I will perceive it differently under different contexts. The way an object lists its neighbors and gives it classifications is also highly relativistic. This means that an object can look completely different under different contexts. The name for an object is always the same though. Also, the stack trace is mostly unaffected by context and emotions. This means I can store information for later to prevent myself from getting lost in thought, and to prevent myself from getting confused by the context of my own thoughts.

### Simon, how did you learn all this about yourself?
#### (it seems like you are just making this shit up!)
I have spent my whole life being myself, and subconsciosly realizing things about myself. I have spent the past 2 years making those realizations conscious. I really only needed to simply watch and analyze my own thought process in order to learn most of these things.

## Discerning Subconscious Thoughts
So, since my thoughts are represented by objects, and I can check the data on those thoughts, I can easily differentiate conscious thoughts from subconscious thoughts. Subconscious thoughts will have various markers on them that suggest they should not be trusted. When I see these markers, I change the thoughts to from {[idea]} to {consider thinking about [idea], as an alternative to [counter-idea]}. There are a lot more specifics on this that I don't think you are interested to here, so I won't bother writing them down. Anyways, I use markers and warning labels to prevent myself from getting tricked by my subconscious. These same markers have almost no effect on my subconscious; adding the [counter-idea] helps the subconscious with some of its thoughts, but not that much. So, this method is a pretty good way to maintain harmony between my conscious and subconscious.

## Controlling the Subconscious
Keep in mind, I am not my conscious. My subconscious is a part of who I am too.
