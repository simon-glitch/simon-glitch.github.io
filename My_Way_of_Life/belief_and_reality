Avlin Plantinga believes that human beings have one or more belief-producing processes. I like ths idea, just for its inquisitional and inspirational value to me (i.e. is value to me, as measured by its ability to inspire me and help me inquire new ideas of my own).

However, I don't really believe that humans have a belief-making property. In fact, I don't think beliefs are even fundamental in the brain. They seem like seconday, yet obvious effects (or constructions) of the brain's perception. I argue that the things Plantinga calls "belief-making processes" are **instead** "reality-defining processes", or "ontological-perception-building processes". As humans, we observe the world around us.

## Perception
We learn to accept the reality we are presented with, at least until our theories begin to contradict it. Even then, we will simply change the reality we are presented with, or simply change ourselves to perceive a different presentation. Thus, the reality we are presented with stands as the only acceptible option. We might imagine other things, and say that those things are "another reality". However, if we truly believe that those things are real, then the reality that out belief presents us with includes those other things, in some way or another. Thus, the statement holds true, without exception:
* **We can only accept the reality we are presented with.**

Doesn't it follow that "what you see if all there is"? Actually, no. Extending "see" to mean "perceive", this statement doesn't hold true. The reality you are presented with is not necessarily fully perceived. You might only perceive 80% of what you are presented with. The rest of it can very feasibly just fly past your mind, even missing your subconscious. You might believe in 50% of that remaining 20%, even though you can't quite perceive it. There are some things that you don't see; you don't have a conception or perception of them; you don't have any theories or hypothesis for them; yet, you might still have a vague feeling of their existence. Or they might simply be there, waiting for you to look their way one day, hidden in plain sight. If you have no idea where your TV remote is, that doesn't mean that it stopped existing. Maybe it is right under your butt and you just haven't checked there yet. You might spend hours searching for it, and theorize that the rude kid you don't like threw it away. And then, you might suddenly find it, and conclude "what I see is not all there is after all!". If you are really clever, you'll apply that to people too. The thought "this person seems suspicious..." will become "there might be more to them than what I see; their friends seem like nice people; I can *assume* they are not a psychopath, for now at least.".

You know what is true? "What you see is what you set, for now.".

By the way, I am working on improving my short quotes with deep meaning. But it's kinda hard to find them, and it's even harder to analyze (and understand) them.
