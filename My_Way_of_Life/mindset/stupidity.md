- an essay about the definitions of various similes to stupidity, which accounts for the context-sensitive nature of stupidity (and intelligence).

## Context Matters
Stupid and its synonyms, in modern times, are always used in a context-sensititve manner. Typically, we need to have a subject or task to relate the adjective too. A person can be classified under these adjective if they lack knowledge or intellectual capability specific to some given task or subject. This means that a person can be stupid in basketball, but be perfectly good at analyzing bacteria samples.

The term "knowledge" (as used in the rest of the article) refers to knowledge {in a specific {subject, field, theory} or for a specific task}. This means that stupidity, competence, intelligence, and smartness are all **context-sensitive**.

## Synonyms for Stupid
In casual conversations, all adjectives that {describe any quality of a person's intelligence as being suboptimal or imperfect} are perfect synonyms. Perfect synonyms to a word (or term) have the exact same meaning as the word (or term), and can {merely be subsituted for eachother in the sentance} without {changing the meaning of the sentence}. This means that the following statements all have the same meaning (when used in casual conversation):
* that guy is stupid
* that guy is dumb
* that guy is foolish
* that guy is a fool
* that guy is moronic
* that guy is a moron
* that guy is idiotic
* that guy is an idiot
* that guy is unintelligent
* that guy is an imbecile (note 1)
* that guy is a smart ass (note 2)
* that guy is a stupid idiot (note 3)

Notes:
1. Imbecile implies that the person failed a task; sometimes this actually means "that guy was incompetent at that task". The speaker might insist that their statement also implies "that guy is also stupid", but the latter statement is probably not true (or not justified).
2. The term "smart ass" also means "that guy is overconfident". Often times there is a causal connection, such as "that guy is stupid because he is overconfident" or "that guy acted stupid because he's so cocky".
3. Combining adjectives adds emphasis rather than adding meaning. "is a stupid idiot" is the same as "is very stupid".

## Distinguishing Synonyms
In formal conversations and texts, typically the conversations and texts of scholars, the synonyms for "stupid" actually distintly different meanings. Scholars, and most people who are good at public speaking, tend to pick the correct synonym. Therefore, they portray more meaning when they use these words.

### Stupid
One who is "stupid" is one who simply doesn't know important or relevant information. For example, one might make a mistake as a result of not knowing why the action was a mistake. Stupid people can be educated (or even just informed) in order to cure them of their stupidity.

### Dumb
One who is "dumb" either learns at a slower rate, or with a delay, in comparison to what would normally be expected.

The "expected" norm tend to be either:
* the average case
* the optimal case, especially in the context of moral problems

This means that an opportunity for learning has to be created in order for the classification of "dumb" to be justifiably given to someone. For example, if you tell someone that crossing the street is dangerous when the crosswalk signal is set to "stop", and they cross the street during heavy traffic, then either:
* they are dumb,
* you are very stupid.

The former case is typically the more common. The latter case is an edge case where they might know of a trick or strategy to make the road less dangerous. Realistic edge case of the example: the crosswalk was about to switch to "go" and all of the cars are currently decelerating due to a red light.

### Foolish
A fool is one who misuses (or underutilizes) the knowledge one has. For example, a fool might now that he's supposed to put a jack under his car in order to lift it up so he can exchange tires. But then, he might only use 70% of the lifting height of the jack. And let's say that he's just barely able to get the tire off, but he has to pull and tug on the tire a lot. What really makes him a fool is when he realizes that the tire is being pressed against the ground, but doesn't consider using the jack that he just used to life the car some more. A non-fool would realize he had made a mistake not lifting the car enough, and use the jack to life the car to 100% of the lifting height.

#### Evil is Foolish
Evil is often foolish, because evil often doesn't actually generate the maximum amount of benefit for the person who performs it. I will discuss this in depth later.

### Morons
The word "moron" is often used to mean "stupid person". This means that "stupid" and "moronic" actually tend to be perfect synonyms of eachother, even in many formal contexts. However, considering the connotation of "moron" and the situations I've seen it used in, I think that "moronic" is a specific sub-case of "stupid".

A moron, as I'll define it, is someone with either:
* faulty understanding of their knowledge,
* or a lack of knowledge related to the **fine details** of the given {subject or task}.

A moron can (usually) transform into a non-moron by practicing the task or exercising their knowledge. Sometimes they just need to study the material that their knowledge came from and specifically look for fine details that they might have missed. However, fine details often are not found by repeatedly studying the same material over and over. Usually one needs {inspiration from external sources, or more experience from practice} in order to find the fine details. This is true because fine details are often non-obvious.

In summary, "moronic" means "stupid in a non-obvious way" or "stupid for non-obvious reasons".

### Foolish Morons and Moronic Fools
Moronicness and foolishness actually seem quite similar, because one not understanding one's knowledge can cause one to underutilize one's knowledge. Thus, there is a special intersection of foolishness and moronicness. So, in theory a foolish moron (or a moronic fool) is actually a moron and a fool.

Often times, a foolish moron is simply referred to as a fool, somce the foolishness is easier to prove and measure than moronicness. Think about it: it's easier to measure someone's actions then their actual understanding, since you can't directly measure or read the mind.
