
# Infinitely Distinct

Every object that is different instance has unlimited capacity to be unique. Every person can be unique in a myriad of ways, even when they fit into all of the typical social norms. Every location is unique, even if it looks the same as the next location. There are always tiny and minute differences. Some sentences and statements might be repeated (like this one), but the context in which each occurence is uttered is still unique.

# Everything Is Unique.

Going further, everything has exceptions. There is no global rule that can be applied to every object, unless the objects are defined and selected in an extremely specific way to begin with. There are very facts that we can be sure of, and everything can be questioned.

# Understanding Uniqueness
No. I think there are 4 groups of people (as far as understanding uniqueness is prevelant):
1. people who just don't know that everything is unique (have never been told it, or don't believe it);
2. people who know that everything is unique, but don't understand the implications; they are essentially ignorant, and they have the same views and understanding as the people in the 1st group;
3. people who are amazed by the fact that everything is unique; these people can't stop mentioning it, and they always talk like its some kind of big deal; they are all like "ah, don't worry you're unique"; they see uniqueness as a sign that life is perfect and that we don't need to worry about anything; they think that being unique is some of speical or impressive quality; the reality is: if everyone is unique, then being unique is not a really impressive personality trait; in essence, uniqueness becomes a norm that we should avoid needlessly obsessing over;
4. people like me, who understand the importance of unique, and see it as very obvious; because it is obvious and universal, we avoid discussions that revolve around the idea; we use uniqueness as an expected rule and a norm of our reality; we have no special appreciation for it; it is just another fact that we have learned.

## Conclusion
We should never appreciate **individuality**. Instead, we should appreciate **who** people are and **which character traits** they have.

> It's not just that people are unique, but rather *how* they are unique.

> It's more genuine to appreciate people for their specific character traits, rather than for their uniqueness.
