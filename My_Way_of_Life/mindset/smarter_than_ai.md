# Smarter than AI
I truly feel smarter than AI. I feel like the way I word things is always more on point, more meaningful, more creative, and more concise.

The AI will write out a long sentence, and make long lists of nouns. I will see this and think: we should put more emphasis on each of these nouns individually.
* Like, yeah, humans, dogs, and crow have the same skeletal structure, but let's not just say that. Let's emphasize the unique traits:
  * humans stand tall and proud, while the lowly dog stands firm on its 4 legs and uses its grip to tear its enemies down, little by little. A crow can fly high above the human, making the human seem lowly.
  * Regardless of this, all 3 animals remarkably have the same basic skeletal structure. This similarity is made especially prominent in the case of the animals as embryos.
  * In the early stage of development, the animals all naturally start from the same fundamental structures, and are then given the specialized traits that make them distinctive and interesting in discussion.

I see myself as better than an AI, because, having a deep understanding of this world, I can articulate on these small details and explain exactly how they are so important.
