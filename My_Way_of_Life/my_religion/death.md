Well, the person's soul will wake up on judgement day. Keep in mind that time has no strict rules in the heavens. There are many different space-time planes with different laws and rules. God puts different people in different places, depending on what is appropriate. Time in heaven doesn't run parallel with time on earth at all. Thus, judgement day can vary, relative to each soul.

Let's focus on the example of 1 **human** soul.

* the human dies, and the soul is sent to heaven;
* the soul is then judged; the period of time surrounding judgement is called "judgement day"; judgement day ends when judgement ends;
* during judgement, the soul is refined and cleansed of all sin, evil, imperfection, and impurities; what is left is a perfect, God-loving, immortal being; the more evil the soul is, and the more sins it has committed, the more it is destroyed and warped during the refining process; souls are healed, buffed, or even weakened, as necessary for their occupation;
* once judgement is finished, the newly perfected soul is called an angel
* every angel in heaven has a occupation (i.e. a job); angels are only designed to be perfect in the 3 ways that matter:
  * loving God
  * loving other angels
  * doing their job as a service to God (and the Holy Body)
* angels can have relative weakness in all other aspects, because they don't need any other kind of strength or perfection.


## What about non-believers?
* Not believing in God is one of the greatest sins one can commit. Invalidating or rejecting God is an evil thing. Thus, almost every non-believer has much of their soul destroyed during the judgement process. Some non-believers are actually good enough as human beings that they are not completely destroyed, and that a majority of them goes to heaven.
  * If one has never heard of the Christian God or lacks the intelligence to comprehend it, then one cannot commit the sin of rejecting God. Thus, the uninformed, and people who are greatly mentally disabled, are forgiven for not knowing God.
* However, as God has said: it is hard for any man to avoid making sins. Most people, due to their fallen nature, commit many sins all the time.

## Doesn't Jesus cause us to be forgiven?
Well, yeah, but one will still be judged for one's sins. Jesus simply lightens the judgement. Jesus's blood can cleans souls without destroying them as much as the judgement process does. People who believe in God but don't believe in Jesus end up getting burned pretty hard during the judgement process.
