Well, the person's soul will wake up on judgement day. Keep in mind that time has no strict rules in the heavens. There are many different space-time planes with different laws and rules. God puts different people in different places, depending on what is appropriate. Time in heaven doesn't run parallel with time on earth at all. Thus, judgement day can vary, relative to each soul.
