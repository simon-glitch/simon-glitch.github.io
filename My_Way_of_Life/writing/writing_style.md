There are only 3 general writing styles:

| Style | what it describes |
| - | - |
| Descriptive   | what it is   |
| Narrative     | what I did   |
| Argumentative | what I think |

A piece of text content is written in layers, with [Levels of Detail]() (LoDs). The writing styles are used at various [LoDs]() in the text, and then layered on top of each other.

However, before we get into those nitty-gritty details, we should look at the largest LoD first.
