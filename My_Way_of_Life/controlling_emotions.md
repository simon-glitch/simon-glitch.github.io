
Controlling emotions is simply a matter of defining a mindset about WHY you should have CERTAIN emotions in response to SPECIFIC events.
* Self control is merely a matter of defining HOW emotions are helpful, and exactly what the are supposed to COMMUNICATE to your consciousness.
So, instead of simply reacting to emotions, you should make it a mentality and a life goal to always do this:
* define the emotion as being a warning, indicator, or notification; define the emotion as your subconscious's way of communicating with your conscious.
* Once you have spent time practicing this, all day, every day, you will be able to ascertain self control and self understanding. Not just this, but by giving your emotions definitions, you can make the happy ones MORE impactful and more meaningful than they were to begin with.

If you encounter issues with this strategy, then you haven't defined the emotions well enough. I suggest you vocalize or write down what each emotion is and what it means (i.e. what it notifies you of).
* You don't have to do this once for every instance of an emotion.
  * You only have to define each emotions once.
* So, you don't have to keep a diary of emotions that are repeated from one day to the next, and you don't have to write down details of specific events that caused emotions.
* However, I would suggest that you record 1 or 2 examples of events that cause each emotion, even if the example events never happened or are fictional.
  * It is helpful to understand where emotions are summoned, that way you can better infer what they should mean.
