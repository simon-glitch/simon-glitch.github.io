# Netherite
It would be nice if we could craft netherite armor purely from netherite as an alternative. It wouldn't break the balance of the game, since 11 to 15 diamonds is arguably less valuable than 12 to 28 ancient debris. It wouldn't be fair for the sword, shovel, and hoe though.

## Trade Offs
`I =` total `Netherite Ingots` needed in order craft.
`E =` extra `Ancient Debris` needed (vs. using the smithing table).
`D =` cost in `Diamonds` (including 7 diamonds for the smithing template).
|Item      | I|  E|  D|
|----------|--|---|---|
|Chestplate| 8| 28| 15|
|Leggings  | 7| 24| 14|
|Helmet    | 5| 16| 12|
|Boots     | 4| 12| 11|
|Pickaxe   | 3|  8| 10|
|Axe       | 3|  8| 10|

Crafting items with incots costs around 2 to 1 extra `ancient debris` per `diamond`.

More precisely:
* the `chestplate` costs an extra 1.867 `ancient debris` per `diamond`,
* while the `axe` only costs an extra 0.8 `ancient debris` per `diamond`.

Actually, this would be a little imbalanced, especially for the axe and pickaxe. Perhaps we should give the ingot-crafted item curse of vanihsing or something, in order to be more fair.
