This is a reflection for self_driving_cars.md, as it was an outline for a speech I did for one of my classes
-->

# Instructions
After presenting each speech, you are required to write a self-critique paper that is two parts: (1) analyze your strengths and weaknesses in your presentationâ€™s content/delivery and (2) outline improvement steps for future speeches. Papers are about one page in length, double-spaced. 

You can upload them to moodle under "Self-Reflection Paper Submissions" - the informative speech is your first self-reflection paper (there will be 3 total - one for the informative, group fundraising, and persuasive.)

# Reflection 1
My strengths in *"Self Driving Cars are Hard to Make"* were:
* I had a relevant topic.
* I had a lot of justification behind the premise. It's hard to find proper academic evidence of this, but many engineers who work on self-driving cars would self-report it as having many challenges, including surprising ones, such as some of the ones mentioned in my speech.
* I had academic evidence backing up the important claims and premises in the speech.

My weaknesses were:
* I never mentioned, cited, or quoted any of my sources. I did at least cite them properly in my written outline though. The reason I didn't mention them in the speech is that I'm not used to mentioning or citing people like that. I'm used to making claims and letting the audience assume that my claims are based on truth.
* I didn't make an effort to establish my own credibility. To be honest, I usually overdo it when I try to establish myself or my ideas as being credible. I'm also so used to getting rejected and insulted on my credibility that I don't care if other people think I'm credible. I assume that everyone thinks I'm not credible, and I always end up emotionally hurt or angry when I argue about whether I'm credible.
    * In conclusion, I try to avoid calling myself credible or right. I believe that other people will not believe me if I tell them that my ideas or claims are credible.
* I didn't feel a need to restate the thesis.
    * At the time, I thought it was too obvious, but now I realize that the thesis was not very obvious and should have been restated or implied a few more times.
* I didn't have my content organized enough.
    * Organizing content is a very difficult thing for me. I've never done it during normal communication before, and I am used to having a **strong** visual aid for it. I'm not sure if note cards would help me with this. Rehearsing the speech about 20 times would help me remember the arbitrary order, but that's not a very good solution. I'll try it with the next speech and see how effective it is.
