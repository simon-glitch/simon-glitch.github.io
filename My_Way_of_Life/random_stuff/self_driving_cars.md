(for "Oral Rhetoric" course at Calvin University)

Do you ever get in the car and feel too tired to drive? Probably not very often, but you probably don't like having to pay attention to the road sometimes. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just, take your eyes off the road sometimes? A self-driving car can drive itself, but that's not an easy feat. We have to consider hardware and software complications.

The car needs eyes, just like you. Sensory equipment on self-driving cars can be obscured by the wheather, but the best equipment is much better than the human eye in all wheather. However, this equipment is expensive, and 

The car can be distracted and even deceived too. Self-driving cars can use the internet to learn about their environment, instead of simply relying on digital sensors, but connecting to the internet brings security concerns. The car could be hacked or even just "DoS" attacked. There is also the risk of the user trying to tamper with the software on their vehicle. For example, an impatient driver might want to install a software mod that makes the car ignore speed-limits, pass other drivers on dangerous roads, cut off other drivers, and cut corners through parking lots. This same software mod could also be malware that makes the car do things the driver did not want, like intentionally hit pedestrians.
