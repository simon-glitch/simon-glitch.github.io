(for "Oral Rhetoric" course at Calvin University)

## general outline
This is the general outlne for the longest and most complex possible form this article could have. Adding more details or section than this quite outline describes would be unnecessary at best, and annoying at worst.

### Hardware
* cost of high quality sensors
* copyright laws lower quality
* repair cost
* faulty hardware
* trade-offs of cheap hardware
* lithium

### Software
* copyrights on software and software usage
* hacking
* malware
* bugs and redundancy
* forced arrest
* user override

### Responsibility
* drivers without licenses
* pedestrians who are trolls
* skill issues
* EMP dangers
* hardware specs *(might be a duplicate / not necessary)*
* intentional outdating (older vehicles)
* tracking pedestrians by their phone *(for their safety)*
* tracking self-driving cars
* scams
    * i.e. people who intentionally incur the probems discussed throughout this article

### AI safety
* ML is not fully understood
* when are the ML model's errors okay?
* computational costs
* evolution and updates


## Article Content

**This article is in its longest form. The speech trascript will probably be slimmed down quite a bit and have many of the clarifying words, such as "some", removed for simplicity.**

Also, I know that there might be too many headers in this article. My note cards for my presentation will probably 

### Intro
Do you ever get in the car and feel too tired to drive? Probably not very often, but you probably don't like having to pay attention to the road sometimes. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just, take your eyes off the road sometimes? A self-driving car can drive itself, but that's not an easy feat. We have to consider hardware and software complications.

### Hardware
#### Costs
The car needs eyes, just like you. Sensory equipment on self-driving cars can be obscured by the wheather, but the best equipment is much better than the human eye in all wheather. However, the best high-quality equipment is expensive, and consumers don't have unlimited money. Well, according to Wired [1], the equipment has gone from costing thousands of dollars to just hundreds. Also, the costs vary. Ultrasonic equipment can cost as little as $15, while a high quality GPS costs $6000. Once the industry has agreed on some standards though, the price of these items will probably come down and be settled.

The car can be distracted and even deceived too. Self-driving cars can use the internet to learn about their environment, instead of simply relying on digital sensors, but connecting to the internet brings security concerns. The car could be hacked or even just "DoS" attacked. There is also the risk of the user trying to tamper with the software on their vehicle. For example, an impatient driver might want to install a software mod that makes the car ignore speed-limits, pass other drivers on dangerous roads, cut off other drivers, and cut corners through parking lots. This same software mod could also be malware that makes the car do things the driver did not want, like intentionally hit pedestrians.
