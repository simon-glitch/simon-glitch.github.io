You want to buy gas, but the gas station always rounds the numbers in their favor.

In theory, you can buy gas either by the dollar or by the gallon. The last time I bought gas though, I was given gas by the dollar. But I asked for a specific number of gallons. It seems they calculate by the dollar if you are pre-paying.

The gas price is almost always slightly higher than what is advertised:
* When buying by the gallon, the price is rounded up.
* When buying by the dollar, the gallons given are rounded down.

The only way to buy gas at the advertised gas price is buy gas by the dollar and pay an integer multiple of the gas price. This means you would have to buy an amount of gas equal to a clean integer multiple of 10 gallons. So always buy 10, 20, or similar number of gallons if you can.

As a consumer, you will need to use a certain amount of gas.
You want to stock extra gas in your car, for convenience,
    but it's okay if you don't fill up the tank all the way.
    Especially if you think the gas price is higher than usual and will be lower next time.
This means the best strategy is to simply buy as much gas as you can
    when you think the price is down, and as little gas as you need to,
    when you think the price is up. So, buy low, and avoid buying high.
However, let's say that for some odd reason, the gas price is the same everywhere,
    all the time. Well, in this case, the optimal strategy is to buy multiples of 10 gallons,
    as I explained earlier. But maybe that's not enough or it's too much.
In which case, it would be nice to have a formula
    to see which amount of dollars is relatively optimal.

Now, you really won't save anything significant from doing this. But hey, I'm curious. Just how much could you save in theory if you used this method every time.

Let's look at some different gas-buying strategies, just so we can see who saves the most. This is such a waste of time!
