# From Intro
> "Most of the discussions of this book are about biases of intuition."
- page 4

**glaring mistake**
(this statement is not true)
> "Most of us are healthy, most of the time, and most of our judgments and actions are appropriate, most of the time."
- page 4


* So, the author wants to limit the "damage" caused by poor decision making and incorrect judgements.
> "an accurate diagnosis may suggest an intervention to limit the damage that bad judgements and choices often cause."

The author was teaching at a seminar in 1969 (source: end of page 4). How old is this book?!?!

The author was 35 years old at the time of the seminar. So, if he is still alive, then he should be about 89 years old right now. I guess that is not too old or extreme. So, this book is an old book, written by an old guy, but at least the author isn't ancient or anything crazy like that.
