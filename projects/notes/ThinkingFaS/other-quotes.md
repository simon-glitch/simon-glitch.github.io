**Bro, no one cares about Amos being funny. How is his sense of humor helpful to your work or the story?**
> "Amos was always very funny,"
- very end of page 5


> "those letters (such as K,L,N,R,V) which in fact occur more freqeuntly in the third position [than in the first]".
- page 7
**I tested this, and found that K actually appears in the 1st position more frequently (3728229411 vs 3425617261). The rest of the letters DO in fact appear in the 3rd positions more frequently. v has the biggest difference in its 1st and 3rd position freqeuncies.**
