## Theme 1 - Book 4, Luxury vs Happiness
As Plato already began to hintimate in books 1 and 2, the just life is the happy life, and making one's own life more luxurious is not always the just thing to do. Plato points out the fatal flaw of luxury: it causes people to become lazy once they have too much of it, and then no work is done (and Plato doesn't mention this last consequence, but the economy would likely collapse in such a situation). The workers in the city, especially the guardians, should accept the happiness that comes to them naturally as a direct consequence of their work, rather than receiving monetary compensations. Plato's suggestion here is essentially to have a mostly communist system.

### Subtheme: Wealth and Poverty
Wealth (or luxury) causes a worker to become lazy, and poverty causes a worker to lack the resources required to work. Thus, a worker needs to have compensation (or assistance) that is just barely enough for him to have the tools and resources reqruired for his works. The balance between wealth and poverty (in this sense) is a difficult balance to maintain, but it is a necessary technicality of running a city / state.

### Subtheme: Class Divisions vs Unity
Socrates argues that dividing the city into separate classes based on wealth will cause it to be divided socially and mentally as well. This division will cause the people of the city to constantly be at war with each other, and thus make them much less prepared for war with entities from outside the city. Thus, we should make sure everyone is paid fairly, and in a manner that doesn't break the unity of the city. We should also make sure, over time, to avoid claiming too much or too little new territory outside the city, since that can **also** cause divisions and problems.

### Conclusion of Theme 1
Humility (in contrast to luxury) is important because it promotes unity.


## Theme 2: Fun is the Deadliest Sin
Music is not recognized as serious and thus often not considered to be a potential threat. This happens because music is well known as being a form of amusement. Amusement is a mask that can blind us to the foolishness of ideas and make us vulnerable to deceiving ourselves. This self deception can take form as twisted jokes that make us forget our human nature, and lazy excuses that cause us to become excessively selfish. This deception can even take form as conspiracies, stereotypes, or stories that are not true.

### Subtheme: temperance
The avoidance of fun, luxury, and selfishness is also referred to by Socrates as "temperance". Temperance is a good habit of self control that prevents a man from  becoming short sighted and committing injustice. A man with good temperance is a master of himself, while a man with bad temperance is a slave too himself. The self-enslaved ends up ceaselessly seeking pointless desires for his whole life and never finds true happiness. A good and moral education of poetry and music will give a man a good temperance and ultimately make for happy city / state. Also, an important part of temperance is accepting one's nature and one's natural talents as they are. This applies even if one might have a less "powerful" and impressive talent than someone else.

## Theme 3: Justice if Minding Your Own Business
Socrates simply said that justice is the art of doing one's own work and not taking the implements or duties of another person's profession. This extends a little further, to: one not meddling in the private affairs of others; one not taking the possessions of others; one not trying to have multiple jobs; and one not trying to have a job that one is not naturally designed / dispositioned to have. Thus, justice is an art of conforming to our nature and respecting the natures of others. What a genius little definition that really wraps things up for **Book 4** (and arguably the entirety of *The Republic*).
