Remember: you need to find the FIRST of Descartes' two arguments for the claim that he is distinct from his body.  Present the argument as best you can. (How does he prove that he is distinct from his body?). Then, tell me whether you think his argument is a good one or not.  That's it. That's what you have to do.



# Descarte's Text
  But certainly although in regard to the dropsical body it is only so to speak to apply an extrinsic term when we say that its nature is corrupted, inasmuch as apart from the need to drink, the throat is parched; yet in regard to the composite whole, that is to say, to the mind or soul united to this body, it is not a purely verbal predicate, but a real error of nature, for it to have thirst when drinking would be hurtful to it. And thus it still remains to inquire how the goodness of God does not prevent the nature of man so regarded from being fallacious.
  
  In order to begin this examination, then, I here say, in the first place, that there is a great difference between mind and body, inasmuch as body is by nature always divisible, and the mind is entirely indivisible. For, as a matter of fact, when I consider the mind, that is to say, myself inasmuch as I am only a thinking thing, I cannot distinguish in myself any parts, but apprehend myself to be clearly one and entire; and although the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body, yet if a foot, or an arm, or some other part, is separated from my body, I am aware that nothing has been taken away from my mind. And the faculties of willing, feeling, conceiving, etc. cannot be properly speaking said to be its parts, for it is one and the same mind which employs itself in willing and in feeling and understanding. But it is quite otherwise with corporeal or extended objects, for there is not one of these imaginable by me which my mind cannot easily divide into parts, and which consequently I do not recognize as being divisible; this would be sufficient to teach me that the mind or soul of man is entirely different from the body, if I had not already learned it from other sources.
  
  I further notice that the mind does not receive the impressions from all parts of the body immediately, but only from the brain, or perhaps even from one of its smallest parts, to wit, from that in which the is said to reside, which, whenever it is disposed in the same particular way, conveys the same thing to the mind, although meanwhile the other portions of the body may be differently disposed, as is testified by innumerable experiments which it is unnecessary here to recount.
  
  I notice, also, that the nature of body is such that none of its parts can be moved by another part a little way off which cannot also be moved in the same way by each one of the parts which are between the two, although this more remote part does not act at all. As, for example, in the cord ABCD [which is in tension] if we pull the last part D, the first part A will not be moved in any way differently from what would be the case if one of the intervening parts B or C were pulled, and the last part D were to remain unmoved. And in the same way, when I feel pain in my foot, my knowledge of physics teaches me that this sensation is communicated by means of nerves dispersed through the foot, which, being extended like cords from there to the brain, when they are contracted in the foot, at the same time contract the inmost portions of the brain which is their extremity and place of origin, and then excite a certain movement which nature has established in order to cause the mind to be affected by a sensation of pain represented as existing in the foot. But because these nerves must pass through the tibia, the thigh, the loins, the back and the neck, in order to reach from the leg to the brain, it may happen that although their extremities which are in the foot are not affected, but only certain ones of their intervening parts [which pass by the loins or the neck], this action will excite the same movement in the brain that might have been excited there by a hurt received in the foot, in consequence of which the mind will necessarily feel in the foot the same pain as if it had received a hurt. And the same holds good of all the other perceptions of our senses
  
  I notice finally that since each of the movements which are in the portion of the brain by which the mind is immediately affected brings about one particular sensation only, we cannot under the circumstances imagine anything more likely than that this movement, amongst all the sensations which it is capable of impressing on it, causes mind to be affected by that one which is best fitted and most generally useful for the conservation of the human body when it is in health. But experience makes us aware that all the feelings with which nature inspires us are such as I have just spoken of; and there is therefore nothing in them which does not give testimony to the power and goodness of the God [who has produced them]. Thus, for example, when the nerves which are in the feet are violently or more than usually moved, their movement, passing through the medulla of the spine to the inmost parts of the brain, gives a sign to the mind which makes it feel somewhat, to wit, pain, as though in the foot, by which the mind is excited to do its utmost to remove the cause of the evil as dangerous and hurtful to the foot. It is true that God could have constituted the nature of man in such a way that this same movement in the brain would have conveyed something quite different to the mind; for example, it might have produced consciousness of itself either in so far as it is in the brain, or as it is in the foot, or as it is in some other place between the foot and the brain, or it might finally have produced consciousness of anything else whatsoever; but none of all this would have contributed so well to the conservation of the body. Similarly, when we desire to drink, a certain dryness of the throat is produced which moves its nerves, and by their means the internal portions of the brain; and this movement causes in the mind the sensation of thirst, because in this case there is nothing more useful to us than to become aware that we have need to drink for the conservation of our health; and the same holds good in other instances.

Descartes argues that the mind is indivisible, and can not be described as a composition of parts. Descartes clarifies the definition of a part, by explaining a key property of the body. When 1 part of the body affects another, the effect can be faked by intermediate parts. What Descartes is describing is a kind of daisy chain (or butterfly) effect, which is common in nature. One change or movement of one part of a collection can cause changes in seemingly unrelated regions of the collection. Also, regardless of which part actually causes the change, and regardless of whether the change **should have** been caused, the part as itself is hard to identify. For example, (as Descartes explained) a pain in the foot could be faked by sensations in prior nerves in the thighs, since the foot nerves run through the thighs. A small object on the far end of a lever can cause the same lifting effect as a larger object on the closer end of the lever. So, if all you can see is one end of the lever, and the object is obscured on the other side, you can not possibly determine the weight of the object without being told exactly where it is along the other side of the lever. This of course, is a classic example of dependent information, but the point still stands. If the brain receives a signal from the body, it can not possibly, truly know (for certain) where the signal came from.

The mind is different from the body, in that it not made up of multiple distinct parts. If it was, then 1 part of the mind could act as a mirage or fake version of another. The mind does not have this issue. All conscious thought in the mind has 1 clear source: the mind itself. Thus, due to the simple nature of how the mind's thoughts cause its own awareness of its thoughts, it can not possibly be categorized as multiple separate parts. The mind always acts and thinks as a unified and self-cooperative whole. Even in the case of hallucinations and confusions, the hallucinatory and confused thoughts can still have their cause attributed to the conscious mind. Thus, the mind is one continuous whole, even though it is often mistaken and can be confused. The mind is mistaken as a whole, lies as a whole, finds confusion as a whole, and escapes confusion as a whole.
