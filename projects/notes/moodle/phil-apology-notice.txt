
I'm sorry, but I can find (detailed) instructions on what to do for the "The Republic" reflection. So, I am going to simply interpret what reflection means in this context. Im my "reflection" (which is a text file, like this, which will be uploaded to Moodle), I will probably make mistakes, which might be caused by my lack of understanding what "reflection" is supposed to mean in this context. So, please, I ask that you forgive me for my misunderstandings and incorrect interpretation.

So, for example, I am assuming that "reflection" does not include a lot of my opinions, since opinions tend to be *(how do I say this?)* not reflective.

I also hope that the formatting here is OK with you. My highschool always complained about formatting (I don't know why, please don't ask me), so I am aware that you might dislike the format of this file. I really hope that you are at least able to read it. If you can, then you SHOULD be reading this sentence. In order for me to know that this file is (in fact) readable (and that you do, in fact, exist) please send me an email, containing the words "LAST TO CAST: I read the message!". I am pretty sure the probability of you even reading this file is approximately 0.000000000000000000000000000000012%, but I'll have to wait and see *(I guess)*.
