(for Philosophy course @ Calvin)

<i>context:</i>
* *Lament For A Son* is a Chronicle, published in 1987, authored by Nicholas Wolterstorff.

## Grief is alien to me
Maybe I don't feel the Nicholas Wolterstorff's pain because I am a bit cold. I often think like a utilitarian and have a highly rational perspective on certain topics. Of course, I am human, and I enjoy being emotional. I actually enjoy feeling sad (since sadness is a way to recognize the difficulties of life). At the end of the day, I see grief as being a good thing.

We **should** feel grief, since it is the ultimate recognition of the good qualities of what has been lost. Wolterstorff indirectly affirms this, when he says:
> "When the gift was finally snatched away, I realized how great it was."
* The point here is that grief made Wolterstorff realize the his love for his son.

## I take everything for granted
There is this idea of taking things "for granted". It has become so popular in the modern world, but why? Why should we worry about taking things for granted. Well, in my opinion, we should be aware of the possibility, but we should really aboid worrying about it. Why do I make this claim? Well, consider the extreme of the alternative: Imagine if instead of taking things for granted, we obsessed over every emotional detail of every small thing. Imagine if we tried to be maximally emotional and maximally sensitive to the emotional implications of everything all of the time.

Now, I don't think anyone is afraid of that kind of scenario happening. I am just giving my criticism on {the importance of taking things for granted}. I think we should take things for granted. Why? Well, if we take things for granted, we can simplify our thought process in the present moment and avoid over-analysing everything. To be fair, I am not completely alone in this way of tihnking. Wolterstorff also wants to move on, and knows that he should avoid overthinking things. Wolterstorff wrote "I will not endlessly gaze at them. I shall allow the memories to prod me into doing better with those still living". The word "them" refers to his regrets, but the author could also be implying "grief" or "feelings".

## Holidays are meaningless to me
Now, I know my perspective is somewhat biased, and I try my best to be open minded to other perspectives as I read "Lament For A Son". However, I found to be really ontologically and conceptually bland for my tastes. I am all too familiar with the idea of "taking things for granted" and treasuring the moment. I am all too familiar with the profound implications of a person's death. I am also highly critical of certain parts of the text, where Wolsterhoff shines a light on my own flaws. For example, "The worst days now are holidays: ... days meant as festivals of happiness and joy...". This quote sticks out to me, because I realize that those days only feel important because of the excessive amount of social interactivity. Typically, we meet with all of our family members on holidays. Often times, there are many people who we only meet with on holidays, or who we never think about on non-holidays.

Thus, grief is sometimes forgotten on the non-holidays. I like to take this logic on step further: we don't love our family members when we aren't actively thinking of them. If we moslty think of someone on holidays, then we don't have a strong bond with that person, and that person really is not very important in our lives. This idea does become quite extreme in the context of a son, though.

Consider that parents are willing to sacrifice their lives for the sake of their children, and it is obvious that a parent has a strong bond with their child. With this in mind, we can conclude that Wolterstorff always has and always will love his son dearly. This means that Wolterstorff thinks about his son all the time, not just on holidays. Regardless of that, the idea of {holidays being times of increased thoughts about others} is still relevant. I honestly feel like some people are unimportant in my life, and that they only exist when I meet with them in-person. This is especially true of people who don't keep in touch with me online. If one doesn't send me a text-message or DM (direct message) once a month, then one is not important in my life. In fact, I will avoid thinnking about these unimportant people, and I will show them my disappointment when we do meet holidays. Well, at least, that is what I have done in the past. This method of trying to make my point about how they don't care about me has never effectively changed their behavior. In case it's not clear to you, I am saying that: I wish people were more genuine (i.e. honest) about how much they actually care about me.

### Am I wasting your time making an off-topic point ...
### that you will probably never understand anyways?

**No.** I apologize if I have hurt your feelings thus far, but I am not trying to waste your time. I was trying to justify my belief, that: Wolterstorff can not genuinely care about his son if he thinks about his son much more on holidays than he does on other days. Therefore, Wolterstorff should accept the fact that he stopped caring about his son a long time ago. He should admit that his grief is hollow void of false emotions that the devil uses to trick him into feeling unnecessarily sad.

I am not saying that Wolterstorff doesn't love his son. I am saying that, at a subconscious level, he doesn't care anymore, and that he should realize that at the conscious level as well. Dead people are irrelevant most of the time, and we should be wise in deciding when to bother thinking about them. We shouldn't let the disagreement between our conscious emotions and are subconscious knowledge drive us towards irrational and poorly justified conclusions.

## Maybe I need to become a better person?
The headers in this essay are really making me realize how flawed I am. I am always trying to address these flaws, just like how Wolterstorff is triyng to address his flaws. Well, the book doesn't really talk about that (I couldn't even find a good quote), but grief does involve a learning process, since it moves people in an emotional, dramatic, significant way. As Wolterstorff points out though, grief is difficult to deal with. "Death is awful, demonic. If you think your task as comforter is to tell me that really, all things considered, itâ€™s not so bad, you do not sit with me in my grief". Yeah, he makes a good point there.

He should really keep in mind though, death is only awful for those who live in the absence of the dead. Death is actually not that bad for the dead. When we die, we get a chance at going to heaven and experiencing an eternal life with God. Our eternal life is not just eternal, but also fulfilling. In fact, it is so fulfilling that it doesn't even need to be eternal (for me). I have already experienced God's love while here on Earth, and I already feel fulfilled. I am nonetheless excited about my eternal future, but I am not very concerned with time.
