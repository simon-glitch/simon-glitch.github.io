
Throughout the speech, David is asking us to think about where our thoughts come from. He doesn't want us taking our own beliefs for granted. It is pretty easy to ignore my own sources and forget that some of my beliefs don't really come from solid sources or evidence. Thus, I think David has a pretty solid point here.

Honestly, I don't know what self worship means. Does it mean foolishness.

In the quoted, paragraph, what "forces" is David referring to in "these forces"? Is he referring to this force: "on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down."?

If everybody is set to the default setting right now, and never leaves it (i.e. "there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of"), then how can anyone ever exit that setting? David is claiming that no one has ever been outside of the setting, thus it is a universal, inescapable constant. Of course, I see that both of these claims are wrong and that David does a really poor job at wording his sentences. He uses words like "you" instead of "some people". Half of the things David says about "you" don't apply to me.

In conclusion, I think some of the things David says are not true, because many of his statements are generalized to too many types of people. David's point in the speech is that we need to pay attention, and look out for the consequences of our self centeredness. David is saying that we can still be self centered, but we need to be willing to admit that we are flawed, and to adapt accordingly.
