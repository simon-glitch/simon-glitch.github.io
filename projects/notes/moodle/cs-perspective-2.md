## Question 3
**3. Which devotion resonates with you the most and why?**
* I'm pretty sure that your "devotions" were too short for them to "reasonate" with any sensible person. A single sentence, said out of the blue, will never resonate with me or even matter to me. A random sentence, which is only vaguely related to the conversations, will go under my radar as a mistake and I will ultimately ignore it.

So, I will answer a much more practical question:
> Of the 4 quotes, which is the most useful, insightful, and important?
* to this, I give my answer:
  * Obviously, "Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might" is trying to convey a very helpful message. Of course, the sentence is worded like the writer didn't know how to speak proper english. In JavaScript, we can start an expression with "let", but there are no verbs in JavaScript. Articles, like "the" are pointless in programming, since they would only be useful when describing relationships that would be better described with class architecture or some kind of janky variable manipulation. English and JavaScript are so vastly different that I shouldn't even compare them, should I? So, starting an ENGLISH sentence with "let" truly is stupid. It doesn't have a meaning like it does in JavaScript. How can "not the wise man boast in his wisdom" be an assignment of a value to a variable? It doesn't even look like it has anything to do with variables or parameters.
  * So, I have proven that I am justified in replacing the original sentence with a better one of my own. The following sentence is *authored* by me, and *inspired* by the original sentence:
    * "Wise men should never boast about their wisdom. If they are truly wise, then that characteristic will naturally reveal itself to the world through their thoughts and actions. For the same reason, a mighty man should never boast about his might. Good characteristics and strengths do not need to be bragged about, since their qualities will be shown naturally through them merely existing."

## Random side note
I noticed a mistake in the article ("Understanding God and His Redemptive Work in Computer Science"):
    * the article says `"Hello" + "World" = "Hello World"`. However, the space in "Hello World" is not present in the string on the left. Thus, the equation is strictly incorrect. Here is a correct equation: `"Hello" + "World" = "HelloWorld"`, with no space on the right.
    * Also, overloading is such a terrible example of "redefining a behavior of a computer program". I would like to see a real example, such as remaking an API to handle new image file types from the user when setting the user is giving their avatar a custom icon. Honestly, I don't know how to feel about the "programmers create their programs from nothing, but God created the whole world from nothing". The "from nothing"-ness of creation is not important to me. The only reason we should compare programmers to God is that God programmed the world with mathematical and its physics (and perhaps other things?). Programmers are nothing in comparison to God. A programmer can't create anything from nothing. Everything I construct is constructed through the strict limitations of electricity flowing through my computer's circuits and transistors. Thus, their is no "ex nihilo" in programming. Reading the article makes me feel like it is designed to somehow make me stupid and unteach me the most important things that I know.

## By the way, it looks like you don't want to know what I learned?
* I'm not seeing any instructions in your prompt about my learning. My learning is much more important than anything else to me, so it truly is a shame that you are not interested in knowing more about it. I hope I am not wasting too much off your time by writing this.

## Question 1
**1. What can computer scientists learn about God through engaging [in] their discipline?**
* I don't remember ever learning anything about God while programming, directly from the process. I would never even think to attribute any such learning to programming. What would I learn? "Wow, this is so pure and powerful! Is this related to God in any way beyond the obvious fact that this is a blessing from God?" = the answer is "No." The simple quoted fact is the only way programming relates to God, as far as I am concerned.
## Question 2
**2. How can computer science be used to pursue Godâ€™s [work of] redeeming [us and our] world?**
* This is the only important part of the prompt you gave us, in my opinion. * Computer science is how **I** will prusue the fullfillment of God's will. Many people will never learn any CS and will never use it to serve God nor to use it in pursiut of any kind of work for God. I hereby consider all of those people to be useless, pointless technicalities.
