## Questions

1. In Chapter 12 of SbH, Wright argues that the resurrection not only promises hope for the future (the next life) but also hope for the present. Find one quote from the first 5 pages of the chapter that communicates this idea best to you. Explain why you chose that quote.

2. Regarding Salvation, Wright reports that the normal Western Christian view (salvation is about "my relationship with God" in the present and about "going home to God and finding peace" in the future) is not what the New Testament teaches. What then does he claim is a better understanding of salvation? Try to put his thoughts in your own words.

3. What are the three most important things you learned about "the kingdom of God" from Wright's teaching in chapter 12?

4. According to Wright in Chapter 13, what is the difference between 'building the kingdom' and 'building for the kingdom'?

5. What types of things, do you imagine, will be brought forward into God's new world? Can you think of any examples from your own life?

6. "God's eventual kingdom will be a fresh gift of transformation and renewal." There will be both continuity and discontinuity. What do you think are the limits as to how discontinuous it will be? What do you think are the limits as to how continuous it will be?

7. "It is, rather, that people who believe in the resurrection, in God making a whole new world in which everything will be set right at last, are unstoppably motivated to work for that new world in the present." Why do you think Wright believes this?

8. Wright focuses quite a bit of energy elucidating the injustice of wealth distribution. What present injustice in the world are you most aware of?

9. According to Wright, what can/should artists be doing for the kingdom?

10. Wright uses many words to describe how the 'good news' might be rightly communicated. Which phrases do you find most winsome/compelling/attractive? By contrast, have you ever been evangelized in a na√Øve, tactless, frightening, or bullying way?


## Responses

### 1
Wright Claims that the resurrection happens within our world and within us individually. So, resurrection is all-encompassing and multi-dimensional.

The resurrection is not ONLY a single event in the future. Many people imagine the resurrection as happening at the end of time, but it is actually happening in the present. As a follower of Christ, one experiences continuous personal resurrection (partial resurrection and purification) during the present.

### 2
Defeating death doesn't just mean we go to heaven. Salvation means we join God's community. The soul and the body will be resurrected, and live with God in salvation.

<!-- Salvation also happens continuously, along with resurrection. And we aren't necessarily leaving to the kingdom of God, since the kingdom is already forming down on Earth. -->

### 3
Wright emphasizes 3 facts about the kingdom of God:
1. the kingdom is not merely heaven
2. the kingdom is a place in time, in the future; the kingdom of God will be brought down **to** Earth
3. many modern changes have reduced the kingdom of God to individual beliefs and individual salvation (i.e. each person can imagine the kingdom as being whatever they want it to be, and each person gets their own kingdom)

The resurrection (and life) of Jesus was purposed for teaching us to become agents of God on Earth.

### 4
We are actively working towards making a better world, so we can eventually have the kingdom of God.

Building **for** the kingdom is so important because it means we are building with a purpose.

> **Building for the kingdom is like building for the cathedral. Merely building the kingdom (without much purpose) means the builders would be building without having personal connections between each other. The lack of connections would make the workers a disconnected and weak body (as a group body).**


### 5
Only good things, like beauty and kindness will be allowed into God's new world. All things with even the smallest amount of bad will either be rejected or fixed so they no longer have any bad to them. God's kingdom will be perfect in every tiny little way.

### 6
The limit of disconuity total anihilation. Some things will be completely removed from existence, and will no longer be capable of existing, even in our imaginations and thoughts.

The most continuous things will be come founding principles, and will be connected to everything in a meaningful and honorable way.

Other things, such as passion will also be continued. Things like ecological problems and sickness will be discontinued.

## Syntodes
A Syntode is a piece of syntax. Each Syntode 

```
Syntode {
  name: String,
  alt_names: String [],
  prescanner: RegExp | null,
  never_contains: Syntode | Syntode.dne,
  always_contains: Syntode | Syntode.none,
  disqualifiers: Syntode [...] | Syntode.none,
  structure: Syntode [...] | Syntode.any,
  can_not_start: Syntode,
  can_not_end: Syntode,
}
```

`Syntode [...]` means a list of Syntodes.

## Convenient Constants
The Syntode constructor has many built-in constants. These constants are pre-defined syntodes, which can be used
