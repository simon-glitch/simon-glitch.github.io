1)	In Chapter 12 of SbH, Wright argues that the resurrection not only promises hope for the future (the next life) but also hope for the present. Find one quote from the first 5 pages of the chapter that communicates this idea best to you. Explain why you chose that quote.

2)	Regarding Salvation, Wright reports that the normal Western Christian view (salvation is about “my relationship with God” in the present and about “going home to God and finding peace” in the future) is not what the New Testament teaches. What then does he claim is a better understanding of salvation? Try to put his thoughts in your own words.

3)	What are the three most important things you learned about “the kingdom of God” from Wright’s teaching in chapter 12?

4)	According to Wright in Chapter 13, what is the difference between ‘building the kingdom’ and ‘building for the kingdom’?


5)	What types of things, do you imagine, will be brought forward into God’s new world? Can you think of any examples from your own life?

6)	“God’s eventual kingdom will be a fresh gift of transformation and renewal.” There will be both continuity and discontinuity. What do you think are the limits as to how discontinuous it will be? What do you think are the limits as to how continuous it will be?


7)	“It is, rather, that people who believe in the resurrection, in God making a whole new world in which everything will be set right at last, are unstoppably motivated to work for that new world in the present.” Why do you think Wright believes this?

8)	Wright focuses quite a bit of energy elucidating the injustice of wealth distribution. What present injustice in the world are you most aware of?


9)	According to Wright, what can/should artists be doing for the kingdom?

10)	Wright uses many words to describe how the ‘good news’ might be rightly communicated. Which phrases do you find most winsome/compelling/attractive? By contrast, have you ever been evangelized in a naïve, tactless, frightening, or bullying way?
