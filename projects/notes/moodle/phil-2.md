
By the way (I know I am gonna sound really stupid for saying this), but the arrangment of the attachments / materials on moodle is SUPER confusing (I am really sorry, but it just confuses me).

> "This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre"
  > That was not in the printed text that I read. I thought the story was being literal. What is the point of having a analogy like this in here? It makes no sense to me.

## Prompt
> ...And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving.... The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.

> That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing...

## Question
What is Foster-Wallace's point here?  Use at least two examples from his speech to illustrate your claim. Do you think that what Wallace says in this address is true or probably true?  Why?  Why not?

## Note
Aim for 200 words exact.

## Response
Throughout the speech, David is asking us to think about where our thoughts come from. He doesn't want us taking our own beliefs for granted. It is pretty easy to ignore my own sources and forget that some of my beliefs don't really come from solid sources or evidence. Thus, I think David has a pretty solid point here.

Honestly, I don't know what self worship means. Does it mean foolishness.

What "forces" is David referring to in "these forces"?
* this force? vvv
  * "on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down."

If everybody is set to the default setting right now, and never leaves it (i.e. "there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of"), then how can anyone ever exit that setting? David is claiming that no one has ever been outside of the setting, thus it is a universal, inescapable constant. Of course, I see that both of these claims are wrong and that David does a really poor job at wording his sentences. He uses words like "you" instead of "some people". Half of the things David says about "you" don't apply to **me**.
