* An essay
* Authored by: Simon Willover
* Written for course: 23/FA CORE-100-12 - Community and Commitments
* Intructor: Sung Soo Lim, Ph. D.

# Prompt
In CORE 100, we have explored several significant ideas in Reformed theology: the doctrine of creation, the fall, **redemption**, and restoration. In an essay of three pages, analyze how Reformed theology shapes your understanding of [Sustainability or Global Regions & Culture]. Your analysis should use specific evidence and examples from our course readings.

## Sub Goals:
* Christian Perspective
* Core Commitments
* Level of Integration
* Quality of Writing

## TODO:
* explore how [Reformed theology] shapes the readers understanding of [Sustainability] and other modern issues. Also, use logic to deduce how the reader **should** understand [Reformed theology]. Justify this with descriptions on how the reader **could** use [Reformed theology] for the greater good and in pursuit of their own personal happiness.

### What does redemption mean in our lives?
Redemptions means:
  * refining and purifying our personality,
  * removing sinful thoughts, habits, and tendencies.

This happens through a learning process:
* find personal flaws, and correct them with self-discipline,
* learn from others by being open-minded,
  * if one does not do this, then one is bound to be controlled by one's sin,


# Essay Response
## TODO: add an actual quote from S.B.H.
Redemption is a concept that (according to N. T. Wright) is ecaping modern Christians. It is becoming more and more alien as people's mindsets drift further into sin.

> "If we are going to talk about what is wrong with the world, [then] we should be [willing] to [receive] those [same critiques,] [reflected back at ourselves]."
- **N.T. Wright** on what is wrong with the world.




## Weird Christian Thing?
justification => sanctification => glorification;
just => sanct => glor;


# Response
Redemption is an important idea, in its own right. Imperatively speaking, Christians should aim to mitigate sin and become better human beings. Redemption is a process that happens through 3 processes: having hope in Jesus, obeying God, and having faith in God's plan for the world. God can redeem Christians by helping them realize how they can better connect with the rest of the world. Ultimately, this process relies on multiple types of hope. Conveniently, N.T. Wright has written a very useful book on hope, called *'Surprised By Hope'* (acronym: SBH).

According to N. T. Wright, redemption as a concept is escaping modern Christians. It is becoming more and more alien as people's mindsets drift further into sin. Redemption and many other good things can be achieved through hope. In SBH, Wright defines the Christian hope as:
  * "what you get when you suddenly realize that a different worldview is possible, a worldview in which the rich, the powerful, and the unscrupulous do not after all have the last word." - SBH, page 75.

A key element of the Christian hope is the hope for salvation through Jesus.
* Salvation is a subprocess of resurrection. Justification is a prerequisite process to salvation and begins in our mortal life here on Earth. This process of justification is important for holy, Godly reasons and for Earthly, present reasons. We can use this process to become more perfect, and achieve more success in the present world. Therefore, our future resurrection is surprisingly relevant to our current lives, in multiple ways. Some Christians even believe that we are already in the "end times" (SBH, page 118), because the world is rapidly becoming more sinful in many ways. Thus, the process of working towards salvation, during this life, by increasing justification and seeking righteousness in this life is becoming more relevant as time persists. It is important that we shift our attention towards becoming more righteous in the modern era. With all of this in mind
* Also, "the large-scale future hope of Christians, the hope for the renewal of the whole world" - SBH, page 118. This is true, because the renewal of the world, both in the present and the future also means individual salvation for every follower of Jesus.

Obviously, it follows that hope is part of redemption. Redemption is part of Reformed Theology, and Redemption is relevant to Sustainability. The last claim is proven by the fact that sustainability is supported by God, and redemption encourages us to be better servants of God. Sustainability being supported by God is proven by Godâ€™s commandment to be stewards of the land and to do good in the world.
