# Prompt
In CORE 100, we have explored several significant ideas in Reformed theology: the doctrine of creation, the fall, **redemption**, and restoration. In an essay of three pages, analyze how Reformed theology shapes your understanding of [Sustainability or Global Regions & Culture]. Your analysis should use specific evidence and examples from our course readings.

## Sub Goals:
* Christian Perspective
* Core Commitments
* Level of Integration
* Quality of Writing

## TODO:
* explore how [Reformed theology] shapes the readers understanding of [Sustainability] and other modern issues. Also, use logic to deduce how the reader **should** understand [Reformed theology]. Justify this with descriptions on how the reader **could** use [Reformed theology] for the greater good and in pursuit of their own personal happiness.

### What does redemption mean in our lives?
Redemptions means:
  * refining and purifying our personality,
  * removing sinful thoughts, habits, and tendencies.

This happens through a learning process:
* find personal flaws, and correct them with self-discipline,
* learn from others by being open-minded,
  * if one does not do this, then one is bound to be controlled by one's sin,


# Essay Response
## TODO: add an actual quote from S.B.H.
Redemption is a concept that (according to N. T. Wright) is ecaping modern Christians. It is becoming more and more alien as people's mindsets drift further into sin.

> "If we are going to talk about what is wrong with the world, [then] we should be [willing] to [receive] those [same critiques,] [reflected back at ourselves]."
- **N.T. Wright** on what is wrong with the world.




## Weird Christian Thing?
justification => sanctification => glorification;
just => sanct => glor;


# Response

Redemption is an important idea, in its own right. Imperatively speaking, Christians should aim to mitigate sin and become better human beings. Redemption is a process that happens through 3 processes: having hope in Jesus, obeying God, and having faith in God's plan for the world. God can redeem Christians by helping them realize how they can better connect with the rest of the world. Ultimately, this process relies on multiple types of hope. Conveniently, N.T. Wright has written a very useful book on hope, called *'Suprised By Hope'* (acronym: SBH).

According to N. T. Wright, redepmtion as a concept is ecaping modern Christians. It is becoming more and more alien as people's mindsets drift further into sin.
