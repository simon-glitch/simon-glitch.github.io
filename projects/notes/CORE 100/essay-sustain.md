# Prompt
In CORE 100, we have explored several significant ideas in Reformed theology: the doctrine of creation, the fall, **redemption**, and restoration. In an essay of three pages, analyze how Reformed theology shapes your understanding of [Sustainability or Global Regions & Culture]. Your analysis should use specific evidence and examples from our course readings.

## Sub Goals:
* Christian Perspective
* Core Commitments
* Level of Integration
* Quality of Writing

## TODO:
* explore how [Reformed theology] shapes the readers understanding of [Sustainability] and other modern issues. Also, use logic to deduce how the reader **should** understand [Reformed theology]. Justify this with descriptions on how the reader **could** use [Reformed theology] for the greater good and in pursuit of their own personal happiness.

### What does redemption mean in our lives?
redemptions means:
  * refining and purifying our personality,
  * removing sinful thoughts, habits, and tendencies.

# Essay Response
## TODO: add an actual quote from S.B.H.
Redemption is a concept that (according to N. T. Wright) is ecaping modern Christians. It is becoming more and more alien as people's mindsets drift further into sin.

> "If we are going to talk about what is wrong with the world, [then] we should be [willing] to [receive] those [same critiques,] [reflected back at ourselves]."
- **N.T. Wright** on what is wrong with the world.




## Weird Christian Thing?
justification => sanctification => glorification;
just => sanct => glor;
