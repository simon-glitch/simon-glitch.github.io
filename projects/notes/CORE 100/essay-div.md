## Intro
Diversity and difference are two important topics that undoubtedly belong together in intellectual discussions. Diversity is the range of different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives that citizens offer to their community and society. On the other hand, difference (in the context of civilization) refers to the various traits that make each person unique and valuable, regardless of their perspective, culture, and background. Thus, every community must recognize and respect both diversity and difference, to grow itself into a healthier thriving community. Fostering an environment that embraces diversity and difference creates an atmosphere where everyone feels valued, respected, and empowered. With this, they can better commit themselves to their community. Going further, they can even offer their unique perspectives as contributions to the commonwealth, and feel accomplished in doing so. This leads to remarkable innovations, newfound creativity, and far greater empathy within the community. Ultimately, diversity and difference lead to the development of stronger and better communities.


## Diversity
Throughout history, minorities have fought an uphill battle for their rights to be respected. As a result, diversity has become one of the most relevant topics in the modern world. One could reasonably argue that diversity simply is the most relevant topic, due to the vast number of things which depend on diversity. Diversity is a key idea in fostering healthy teamwork and improving the community. Businesses have gone out of their way to enforce diversity by hiring more minorities and bragging about this habit. Like many topics, diversity is complex, with multiple sides and perspectives. Considering how relevant it is, this essay explores these perspectives, in order to help improve the reader's understanding of the topic.

Being multi-sided, diversity has 2 major virtues (pros) and 2 major pitfalls (cons).

### Virtues of Diversity
Firstly, diversity can help us avoid tunnel vision, and give us lots of new perspectives for solving problems. This improved level of perspective, and widening of vocabulary, can allow us to do more, as long as we have the capacity for teamwork. Secondly, diversity can prevent us from neglecting each other and disrespecting each other. Embracing diversity helps to prevent us from harming or hindering each other unintentionally. Thus, diversity is an important ingredient for respect.

### Pitfalls of Diversity
However, when we enforce and chase diversity, it becomes a competition for changing things that don't need to be changed, and we lose sight of our original goals. We arbitrarily hire people from different races and cultures without actually measuring their usefulness as employees. Also, diversity can create too many opinions when we just need to agree on a plan and be decisive; waiting on compromises and hoping for agreements that will never happen can lead to insufficient leadership and make the system collapse.

## Difference
Diversity, of course, falls under the umbrella of difference. Difference, outside of diversity, is also an interesting topic of its own. It has almost the same virtues and pitfalls as diversity has, and is a relevant topic that comes up in many conversations. Practically speaking, difference refers to the difference between different people with different minds and different ways of thinking. Abstractly speaking, difference is a fundamental ingredient of the universe, and understanding it can help one understand reality as a whole. The opportunities for how differences could be leveraged within people groups are especially notable. People with differences can form teams, share ideas, learn from each other's mistakes, and build on each other's differences to a great benefit. Difference is a broad topic, so some specific examples would help the reader to better understand the topic and learn a lot.

## Connecting The Course Materials

*How not to bless the nations*, by David I. Smith, gives an interesting historical take on difference. Consider Abraham, one of the few followers of God amongst the world population. Abraham was given a gift that truly made him distinct: he was destined to be the father of the greatest nation in the world (Israel was the greatest nation at one point in time, even though it is currently a weak and unstable place). Abraham met face-to-face with both adversity and diversity, as he traveled through a land that belonged to others. Abraham didn't know that the people 

From *How not to bless the nations*:
  "This is stereotyping, and it is a particularly fertile source of misunderstanding when cultural differences are in play." Abraham's stereotyping of the Philistines is particularly interesting. Abrahan knew that a Philistine city had been destroyed by God for being unrighteous, and held a stereotype against the Philistines because of that. Abraham then ends up believing that the Philistines do not fear God and are disrespectful, but he is wrong. The Philistines do fear God, and Abraham had simply been led astray by his stereotyping. So, stereotyping, which is the lack of proper recognition of diversity and difference, results in false beliefs and can even lead to the unfair treatment of others.

From *Mere Christianity - Chapter 8 - "The Great Sin"* by C.S. Lewis:
  As C.S Lewis has pointed out, pride is the greatest evil in the world (according to the Christian perspective). In the context of diversity, (self-centered) pride is harmful because it prevents one from recognizing others and encourages behaviors that benefit one at the expense of others. Arguably, pride is the reason diversity is not properly respected in the modern world. Thus pride is the reason that society needs to go out of its way to ensure that diversity is respected. "Pride is [essentially competitive] by its very nature. Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man." This kind of attitude is destined for disrespect and harm and intentionally creates differences just to put one person at a disadvantage to another. This kind of unnatural difference-making is unfair and harmful to almost everyone involved. Thus, an important goal of diversity is to reduce the level of self-centered pride.

*Surprised by Hope* (by N.T. Wright) does a surprisingly good job of discussing the different religious perspectives held by different people. The book is not focused on diversity or difference. Rather, it is focused on providing a correct view of Christianity and giving Christian readers advice on what they should be hoping for. Nonetheless, the book still has subtle themes of diversity and difference. The book implies that Christians should be aware of how their own religious beliefs have been affected (or even malformed) by other religions. Thus, the author, Wright saw good reason to describe the extreme contrasts between the different religions of the world: "There is a world of difference between the Muslim who believes that a Palestinian boy killed by Israeli soldiers goes straight to heaven and the Hindu for whom the rigorous outworking of karma means that one must return in a different body to pursue the next stage of one’s destiny. There is a world of difference between the Orthodox Jew who believes that all the righteous will be raised to new individual bodily life in the resurrection and the Buddhist who hopes after death to disappear like a drop in the ocean, losing one’s own identity in the great nameless and formless Beyond." Wright's exploration of diversity and how it affects a Christian's beliefs goes even further though. As Wright pointed out, many people (even some self-proclaimed 'Christians') believe "the lie [that] all religions are basically the same." The point here is that, from a Christian perspective, there is a wide and diverse range of religious ideas and perspectives that are held by the world's occupants. Wright argues that these ideas should be acknowledged, as lies, so the Christian does not confuse them with the Christian's original beliefs.

However, the discussion on the diverse array of religious beliefs held throughout the world can be extended and generalized. There are also several scientific beliefs and theories which can be misleading. Thus, as a scientist, one should observe with scrutiny and remember that a theory is sometimes just a theory. However, one should also remember that sometimes those theories and beliefs are true. Furthermore, one should not use a difference in beliefs as an excuse to mistreat and judge others for their beliefs. Thus, as a society of humans, we should all listen to and respect each other, even if some of our beliefs and opinions are just wrong. Sometimes a new perspective or an alternative theory is just what the engineer needs to solve a problem. Sometimes the politician needs to be quiet and listen to a colleague of another opinion because oftentimes that other opinion might be right. Even when none of the initial opinions are right, sometimes opinions can be combined via the art of compromise, and an optimal action can be found from them. The hope, in all of this, is that we can embrace diversity, for better, or for worse. Hopefully, we can learn from each other to become a smarter and stronger world.
