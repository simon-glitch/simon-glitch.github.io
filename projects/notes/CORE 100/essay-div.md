# TODO
(a writing guideline from the rubric)
Show understanding, and explore multiple truly distinct perspectives.

# Side note:
You should definitely use GitHub if you are going to write a paper it has commit messages that are way more intuitive than anything available through any other means of writing on a computer.

# Loose idea of what the text maybe could look like
## Intro
Diversit and Difference are definitely distinctly different topic, although the share some deep destinies as far as human histroy is concerned. A logical approach to discussing these topics would be to explore each of theme separately, and then elaborate a grand thesis. This thesis should explain how the reader could better understand the topics and everything that they are meant to ential. Thus, being a rational piece of writing, this paper will do just that.

### What each book does
* 'Surprised by Hope' shows how everyone has a different perspective on life, and points out the flaws in the modern perspective on death.

* 'Thinking Fast and Slow' describes flaws in human logic, which connects to difference in a significant way. Different people can have different ways of thinking, even in the same people group. Of course, many people from similar background do often have similar ways of thinking as a result of their background too. Nonetheless, the world has many different mindsets, ways of thinking, and theories of mind.

* Thinking Fast and Slow, in Chapter 17, contrasts 2 common views on reinforcement: flight instructors believe that they have seen pilots get better after negative feedback; but research has shown that positive reinforcement is more effective than negative reinforcement. A completely separate view is that the pilots only seem to get better after performing poorly, due to the law of "regression towards the mean". The latter view is the correct one here, but the point still stands: there is a vast difference one can find among the different flaws in the reasoning and logic of different people. In this world of different mindsets, different ways of thinking, and different theories, it can be hard for one to filter out the flaws and find the truth.

  * However, we still need to consider each other's perspectives, because of the Illusion of Knowledge.

## Diversity misc...

Diversity has 2 cons and 2 pros to it:

2 pros:
Diversity can help us avoid tunnel vision, and give us lots of new perspective for solving problems. This improved level or perspective, and widening of vocabulary, can allow us to do more, as long as we have the capacity for teamwork.
Diversity can prevent us from neglecting each other, and disrespecting each other. Embracing diversity helps to prevent us from harming or hindering each other uninentionally. Thus, diversity is an important ingredient for respect;

2 cons:
When we enforce and chase diversity, it becomes a competition for changing things that don't need changed, and we lose sight of our original goals. We arbitrarily hire people from different races and cultures without actually measuring their usefuleness as employees;
Diversity can create too many opinions when we really just need to agree on a plan and be decisive; waiting on compromises and hoping for agreements that will never happen can lead to insufficient leadership and make the system collapse;
