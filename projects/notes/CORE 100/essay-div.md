Prompt:
> How does the class material enhance Simon's understanding of Diversity and Difference (DAD)
* todo:
  * expand the context of the response to {everyone's understanding of DAD},
  * and provide insights {for how everyone can improve their understanding of DAD}.


### "How not to bless the nations"
* When Abraham arrives among the Philistines he does not reckon on God already being there; but here again he is mistaken.

# TODO
(a writing guideline from the rubric)
Show understanding, and explore multiple truly distinct perspectives.

# Side note:
You should definitely use GitHub if you are going to write a paper it has commit messages that are way more intuitive than anything available through any other means of writing on a computer.

# Loose idea of what the text maybe could look like
## Intro
Diversit and Difference are definitely distinctly different topic, although the share some deep destinies as far as human histroy is concerned. A logical approach to discussing these topics would be to explore each of theme separately, and then elaborate a grand thesis. This thesis should explain how the reader could better understand the topics and everything that they are meant to ential. Thus, being a rational piece of writing, this paper will do just that.

### What each book does
* 'Surprised by Hope' shows how everyone has a different perspective on life, and points out the flaws in the modern perspective on death.

* 'Thinking Fast and Slow' describes flaws in human logic, which connects to difference in a significant way. Different people can have different ways of thinking, even in the same people group. Of course, many people from similar background do often have similar ways of thinking as a result of their background too. Nonetheless, the world has many different mindsets, ways of thinking, and theories of mind.

* Thinking Fast and Slow, in Chapter 17, contrasts 2 common views on reinforcement: flight instructors believe that they have seen pilots get better after negative feedback; but research has shown that positive reinforcement is more effective than negative reinforcement. A completely separate view is that the pilots only seem to get better after performing poorly, due to the law of "regression towards the mean". The latter view is the correct one here, but the point still stands: there is a vast difference one can find among the different flaws in the reasoning and logic of different people. In this world of different mindsets, different ways of thinking, and different theories, it can be hard for one to filter out the flaws and find the truth.

  * However, we still need to consider each other's perspectives, because of the Illusion of Knowledge.

## Diversity
As minorities have fought an uphill battle for their own rights to be respected, diversity has become one of the most relevant topics in the modern world. In fact, one could reasonably argue that diversity simply is the most relevant topic, due to the vast number of things which depend on diversity. Diversity is a key idea in fostering healthy teamwork and improving the community. Businesses have gone out of their way to enforce diversity by hiring more minorities and bragging about this habit. Like many topics, diversity is complex, with multiple sides and perspectives. Considering how relevant it is, this essay explores these perspectives, in order to help improve the reader's understanding of the topic.

Being multisided, diversity has 2 major virtues (pros) and 2 major pitfalls (cons).

### Virtues of diversity
Firstly, diversity can help us avoid tunnel vision, and give us lots of new perspective for solving problems. This improved level or perspective, and widening of vocabulary, can allow us to do more, as long as we have the capacity for teamwork. Secondly, diversity can prevent us from neglecting each other, and disrespecting each other. Embracing diversity helps to prevent us from harming or hindering each other uninentionally. Thus, diversity is an important ingredient for respect.

### Pitfalls of diversity
However, when we enforce and chase diversity, it becomes a competition for changing things that don't need changed, and we lose sight of our original goals. We arbitrarily hire people from different races and cultures without actually measuring their usefuleness as employees. Also, diversity can create too many opinions when we really just need to agree on a plan and be decisive; waiting on compromises and hoping for agreements that will never happen can lead to insufficient leadership and make the system collapse.

## Difference
Diversity, of course, falls under the umbrella of difference. Difference, outside of diversity, is also an interesting topic of its own. It has almost the same virtues and pitfalls as diversity does, and is a relevant topic that comes up in many conversations. Practically speaking, difference refers to the difference between different people with different minds and different ways of thinking. Abstractly speaking, difference is a fundamental ingredient of the universe, and understanding it can help one understand reality as a whole. The implications of difference within people groups is especially notable. People with differences can form teams, sharing ideas, learning from each other's mistakes, and leveraging each other's differences to a great benefit. Difference is definitely a broad topic, so some specific examples would really help the reader to understand the topic and learn some things.

*How not to bless the nations*, by David I. Smith, gives an interesting historic take on difference. Consider Abraham, one of the few followers of God amongst the world population. Abraham was given a gift that truly made him distinct: he was destined to be the father of the greatest nation in the world (Israel was the greatest nation at one point in time, even though it is currently a weak and unstable place). Abraham definitely met face to face with both adversity and diversity, as he travelled through a land which belonged to others. Abraham didn't know that the people 

From *How not to bless the nations*:
  "This is stereotyping, and it is a particularly fertile source of misunderstanding when cultural differences are in play." Abraham's stereotyping of the Philistines is particularly interesting. Abrahan knew that a Philistine city had been destroyed by God for being unrighteous, and holds a stereotype against the philistines because of that. Abrahams then ends up believing that the Philistines do not fear God and are disrespectful, but he is wrong. The Philistines do fear God, and Abraham had simply been led astray by his stereotyping. So, stereotyping, which is the lack of proper recognition of diversity and difference, results in false beliefs and can even lead to the unfair treatment of others.

From *Mere Christianity - Chapter 8 - "The Great Sin"* by C.S. Lewis:
  As C.S Lewis has pointed out, pride is the greatest evil in the world (according to the Christian perspective). In the context of diversity, (self-centered) pride is harmful because it prevents one from recognizing others and encourages behaviors that benefit one at the expense of others. Arguably, pride (and greed) is (are) the reason diversity is not properly respected in the modern world. Thus pride is the reason that society needs to go out of its way to ensure that diversity is respected. "Pride is [essentially competitive] by its very nature. Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man." This kind of attitude is destined for disrespect and harm, and intentionally creates differences just to put one person at a disadvantage to another. This kind of unnatural difference making is unfair and harmful to almost everyone involved. Thus, an important goal of diversity is to reduce the level of self-centered pride.
