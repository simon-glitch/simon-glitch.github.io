6.	What are the main ways that people today learn about the afterlife?
7)	Do you think there is anything theologically problematic with cremation? Why or why not?
8.	What do you think of Wright’s claim that “What we say about death and resurrection gives shape and color to everything else (p25)?”

I already know what heaven is like. I don't need to read a book to know that. XD. I would say that *Suprised by Hope* is not supposed to tell me what the "next life" is like. The book doesn't seem to fully be about describing merely that. The book seems to be about many other things and their relationship to our perception of the "next life".

The preface does not resonate with me. It is written poorly. At least it summarizes the book well. I guess I resonate best with the author admitting that he is not qualified to talk about death. Also, I liked the fact that the author admitted that other authors have written books about death, and else everything in his book too.

One of the snapshots is not even a specific moment. The author chose 5 "snapshots" because he knew that specific examples can help the reader understand his thought process and perceive the ideas that he is trying to communicate to them.

"**any** hope"? Well, the minimum amount of connection between any 2 hopes, in a pair of hopes, where 1 hope is one of my hopes for this life, and the other hope is one of my hopes for the the next life, is 0%. This is because some of my hopes are completely independent and unrelated.

The maximum connection between any 2 hopes in the category is on this hope:
* the hope to follow God, love him, and be loved by him.

That one hope is shared / present in both the hopes for this life and for the next life. So, the level of connection on that hope is 100%.

I make and have made no special effort to familiarize myself with the teachings of other religions, especially as far as those teachings are related to life after death. I know that Buddhism believes in infinite reincarnation until the soul achieves nirvahna. I don't know much else about Buddhism or any other religion, and I don't really care either.

People learn about the afterlife from reading books about it and listening to other people speak about it. As far as the speed method is applicable: most people learn about the afterlife from their superiors. A superior is a person who is usually older than the listener, knows more, and is highly trusted or honored by the listener. Typically, a person's superiors mainly include: the person's parents, the person's pastor, the person's teachers (from school), and celebrities that the person sees as being credible / intelligent.

No. There is nothing problematic about cremation. Personally, I believe that cremation is the right way. Dead bodies (especially human ones) are useless, gross, and take up space. The safest and simplest way to take care of waste (such as a dead body) is too incinerate it and send it to a land fill.

I would like to go to a land fill when I am cremated. Or maybe I could get dropped from space, at a high velocity, getting cremated by the atmosphere, and having my remains spread across the atmosphere and around the world.

The point of death is that we have finite time in this world. This finite restriction causes people to feel passionate, and feel like they should get the most of their limited time and limited experience. People give their experiences, and their day to day activities purpose. Wright refers to this general feeling of purpose as "color". Plato would refer to as it "nature" or "virtue", because the feeling or purpose leads us to develop skill and talent in our search for accomplishment.

Resurrection is the ultimate response to death. It takes away the scariness of death. This can be seen as devaluing the world, but most people don't use resurrection as an excuse to live an empty life. People have other innate desires and passions, which go beyond death and beyond reincarnation. In this sense, considering this fact, one could justifiably argue that this life hardly matters, and that the next life will ultimately replace this one. However, that argument doesn't work in the Christian system: God judges people based on their first life, thus, the first life **at a bare minimum** matters in the sense of determining how one is judged by God. Of course, the scariness of death can depend on a person's personal beliefs about death and resurrection.

The general observation is that most people believe life is meaningful, regardless of death and regardless of what happens after death. Furthermore, most people believe that the details of the next life depend on their actions in the current life, and that *thus* they should behave well in the current life.

Finally, we can create an objective defintion of morality and purpose, by evaluating how much each person benefits every other person. We can measure the benefits by surveying everyone and asking for their individual, subjective judgements. Thus, by combining all judgements democratically, which I will call **democratic judgement**, we can create an all-encompassing objective judgement for every person and every action. Many people try to conform to their friends, peers, neighbors, and environment to begin with. Thus, many people already believe in and follow a system of democratic judgement to begin with. The official law and law enforcement further maintain and support this idea of democratic judgement. Thus, society, as it is, already gives shape, color, and purpose to the world and the actions of people within the world.

I don't know. Plato's thoughts and ideas upgrade the mind, body, and soul. So I wouldn't put his name before the word "downgrade".

We don't need the bible! We all have the innate ability to hear and talk to the holy spirit. The holy spirit will tell a person everything that they will ever need to know about life, death, and life after death. The church is good because being part of a church community helps one become a better person. Human reason is helpful with all things. Reason and thought helps one build up one's mind. Jesus said that we should love God with all of the mind, body, heart, soul, and strength. We are supposed to love God with our mind. Thus, we should use human reason to improve the mind, and use the mind to improve our human reason. This constitutes a **positive feedback loop**, which ultimately helps us love God with our mind even more, by **loving God** with a stronger and better mind.
