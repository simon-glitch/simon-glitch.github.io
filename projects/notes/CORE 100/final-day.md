Well, to me, the only thing that matters with any event is often {why the event occurred}.

In essence, the IHW is a war for territory. The war is rooted in the fact that Isreal has kept control of Gaza for a long time. As far as the cause of the most recent attack: "Hamas officials cited long-simmering tensions [as the cause], including a dispute over the sensitive Al-Aqsa Mosque sacred to both Muslims and Jews" (from - https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-as-the-war-between-israel-and-hamas-continues). "The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began following Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Six-Day War" (from - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict).

# Other perspective
Ady had an interesting perspective. She explained how *Thinking: Fast and Slow* (by Daniel Kahneman) is very relevant to the Israel - Hamas war (IHW). She said that wars such as the IHW can sometimes happen as a result of System 1 thinking. Generalizing what she said, a nation should contemplate the full consequences and implications of going to war before making any decisions of starting (or intensifying) a war. Generalizing even further, people should think before they speak, especially during an argument or a tense conversation.

Ady also pointed out the fact that Hamas has allowed themselves to be brainwashed by God (or more accurately: their religious beliefs). "In its 1988 charter, Hamas maintained that Palestine is an Islamic homeland." (source: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hamas) Hamas doesn't want Palestine to be under the control of non-Muslims, because the Muslims have a divine right to Palestine.

Ady also mentioned prospect theory. Prospect theory is a concept from *Thinking: Fast and Slow*. The theory is: that people have a strong aversion to loss. People will weigh (perceive) the probability of **losses** as being **higher** than they actually are, and the probability of **gains** as being **lower** than they actually are. Avy then mentioned that the Hamas group is focusing on the successes they had with war in the past. The idea here is that Hamas is afraid of losing their territory, and perceives the significance of their loss of Palestine as being much greater than it actually would be. Thus, (according to Aby) Hamas wants to take a safe bet, relying on past examples, and secure themselves by going to way in Palestine.

Ady argues further that Hamas's strategy of loss aversion via war is unreasonable. We all agree that this war is unjustified, for many reasons, but Ady argues that the war is also not fruitful. I can agree with this. Killing thousands of innocent people and destroying valuable infrastructure almost never benefits anyone. You can look at historical examples. You would see that most military leaders know that capturing land is more profitable when existing infrastructure and capital are preserved.

So, Ady's point is that Hamas is flawed in its decision-making. They didn't do enough critical thinking, they should assume that their religious beliefs are infallible and that they aren't benefitting themselves very much anyway. There is a solid reason that Hamas is referred to as a group of terrorists and that many people refer to this war as simply being terrorism. It **is** terrorism. It is unjustified, unnecessary, and wreckless destruction.
