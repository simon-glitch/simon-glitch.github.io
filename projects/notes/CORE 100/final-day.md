Well, to me, the only thing that matters with any event is often {why the event occurred}.

In essence, the IHW is a war for territory. The war is rooted in the fact that Isreal has kept control of Gaza for a long time. As far as the cause of the most recent attack: "Hamas officials cited long-simmering tensions [as the cause], including a dispute over the sensitive Al-Aqsa Mosque sacred to both Muslims and Jews" (from - https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-as-the-war-between-israel-and-hamas-continues). "The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began following Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Six-Day War" (from - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict).
