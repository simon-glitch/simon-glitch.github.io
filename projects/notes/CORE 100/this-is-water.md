* "This is Water" is a book by David Wallace

* This reflection is authored by Simon Willover

## Questions:
* how can the fish talk (and share a language) if they don't know what water is? Is the word "water" supposed to be semantically referring to "water" in another language or something? I could understand if the fish were simply confused by a word or concept from another language. Furthermore, fish (if they had a language) would probably more accurately translate "water" to mean "world", "space", "here", or "good air", since fish live in water. Furthermore, couldn't water just be described as "lack of dehydration" or "place where you don't get dehydrated", in opposition to places outside of water, where fish do get dehydrated? Now that I am thinking about it, the idea of "water" might very well be just as abstract as space for a fish. Some other names for water could be "flow", "swim", or even something else, like "mobility" or "place of mobility". Or a fish might call water "this this" or "super this" or something strange like that, since fish, by definition, are always in water.

Also, apparently the author of "This is Water" is a fish. Or at least, the narrator is. **Cool**.

Alright, I can empathize with the author on "A huge [proportion] of the [facts and understandings] that I [am certain of] tends to be [inaccurate]".

I am really curious what exactly "at the absolute center of" is supposed to mean.

I used to believe that I am the realest / only real thing in the universe. But recently, I have stopped believing that and feeling that way. Now I feel like I am a tool or property, with a "position" that can't be defined in a deterministic or euclidian way with words such as "center".

The authot apparently did not write this essay for the purpose of preaching. That's STRANGE~! 

"("Learning how to thing)" really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think."

Is all of the CORE 100 Reader "text" this good? This stuff is pretty high quality! There are obvious pitfalls and errors in it, but this is solid writing with a lot of solid, well placed, well written, well connected facts!
