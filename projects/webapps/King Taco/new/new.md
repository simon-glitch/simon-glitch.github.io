# Rethinking My Code
Oftentimes, when programming, I am required to rethink an algorithm from scratch. This happens whenever I have a lot of complex functions and objects. With this project, I have **already** run into the issue, before even testing any of my code. I know testing and debugging are important, but I need to understand my own code 1st!

So, instead of going into detail about the original code, I will instead try to explain my thought process on that the new code should be like.

## Goals
We want to be able to support some basic actions in our card game. For now, I will revert to extreme simplicity, just so I can wrap my head around what I am doing.

There exists a player, which will not even be represented by an object.

There also exists an empty pile, which can simply contain a card.

Finally, there exists a single card, which does nothing and can be placed within 1 of 2 containers:
* the player's hand, which IS represented, by a list
* the discard pile, which IS represented, by a list

I will avoid classes and paradigm-like programming at all costs, just to keep the code as simple as it possibly can be.

```py


```
