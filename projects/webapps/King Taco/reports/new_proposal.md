## Intro
I have **always** wanted to make my own board game or video game. I originally got into programming because I heard that coding was required for making games.

So, I have decided to come up with an interesting game by combining the simple rules of other games. The goal: no health points, no currency, and no boringness. Also the goal: a wide variety of different cards.

The card game I came up with is *King Taco* (TM). The rules are not simple, and I am kinda not really done actually making the game. I guess my goal with this project is not to figure out what the game's exact cards and rules should be.

## So, What Are We Actually Going To Do?
That's a great question!

In order to make this game accessible, we will implement it in HTML. We'll use [Tippy] for tooltips. We will add popup boxes, so we can add zany and fun descriptions to every card. There are a lot of other small things I will also need to do.

## Dependencies
* Tippy (a JS library that adds in powerful UI elements)
* PyScript (for actually implementing Python in our webpage)

### Languages
* Python (for handling the game logic)
* HTML (for actualizing the GUI)
  * CSS (for making the GUI look good and be accessible)
* JavaScript (from Tippy and PyScript)
  * I will write no JavaScript of my own for this project. This project is meant to be Python-based.

## Composition
This project will be composed of very many files, in multiple folders:
* this proposal, and the reports
* a lib library for various extra resources
* a folder for PyScript
* a folder for Tippy
* a folder for the many Python scripts I have to write
* a folder for the extra HTML pages
* a folder for flask
  * I know it seems unnecessary right now, but I will add more server-side features in the future, perhaps when I revisit this project next year!

I hope that's not too many files or anything XD!

## Time Frame
This project will be completed within a time limit, as suggested by professor Rocky. I will make sure to spend no more than 150 hours on the coding for this project. I might not count time for writing the game's rules and for making documentation. Nonetheless, I will try to limit to myself to around 150 hours of work. This means I will use a **time card** to keep track of work done each day, and work done on each part of the project.
* This **time card plan** will also help me manage my time and manage the project better.

I am especially excited to keep track of just how much time I am **utterly wasting** for once. I really love wasting time. That's one of, it not simply just, my strongest suits. I actually have a PhD in wasting time. In case you are wondering, getting that PhD, is inherently, as itself as a process, a waste of time. Ah, look at these beautiful abominations of text, composed words, separated by highly delectable, dare I say even: necessary, c,o,m,m,a,s. Ah yieesss. This is writing at -- no, **BEYOND** its peak. I am definitely not bouncing my shoulders up and down like a weirdo~ while sitting in my chair right now. :)
* FatalError: Simon.js has stopped executing; reason: Simon's happiness exceeded the maximum safe value of 343%.

### Strategies For Ensuring Success Under The Time Frame Restriction
I will also implement some various strategies to be more professional and efficient during this project.

These include: {Time warping}, {Git-ing Gud}, {Pop-ing Some Pills}, {Use-ing Professional Techniques}, and {Write-ing General Side Note-s}

## Alternative Project Ideas
I had lots of alternative project ideas, but I really wanna do King Taco.
