|   A * A^T is symmetric, for all possible A. Proof:
|   |   B = A * A^T
|   |   B_{i,j} = row_i(A)^T dot col_j(A^T)
|   |   ^ from the formula for matrix mul.
|   |   B_{i,j} = row_i(A)^T dot row_j(A)^T
|   |   ^ since A^T is the rows of A turned into columns
|   |   without loss of generality,
|   |   |   B_{i,j} = col_i(A)^T dot col_j(A)^T
|   |   |   by the same logic
|   |   
|   |   v_1 dot v_2 = v_2 dot v_1, for all possible vectors v_1 ans v_2; so,
|   |   |   col_i(A)^T dot col_j(A)^T = col_j(A)^T dot col_i(A)^T
|   |   |   thus, B_{j,i} = B_{i,j}
|   |   This means that B is symmetric.

2nd Theorem (I won't prove this):
|   (A*B)^T = B^T * A^T

3rd Theorem - Compiled Matrix Symmetry
|   If A is symmetric, then C = B^T * A * B is symmetric.
|   C^T = (A*B)^T * B^(T T)
|   = B^T * A^T * B
|   |   A is symmetric, so:
|   |   that = B^T * A * B
|   |   which = C
|   C^T = C, therefore C is symmetric

## To Prove
IF a matrix A is symmetric, then it is orthongally diagonalizable:
|   Imagine that P^-1 just so happens to magically = P^T.
|   If this is the case, then:
|   |   P * P^T = P * P^-1 = I
|   |   Now, we can notice that when P = [x_1, x_2, ... x_2]:
|   |   |   Q = P * P^T
|   |   |   Q_{i,j} = x_i dot x_j
|   |   Looking at I, we see that:
|   |   |   I_{i,j} = {1 when {i == j}; and 0 when {i != j}}
|   |   |   if x_i dot x_j = 0, then x_i and x_j are orthogonal to each other
|   |   Thus, if P^-1 = P^T, then each column of P will be orthogonal to each **other** column of P.
|   
|   Maybe not needed?v:
|   |   The same follows for P^T, even though it's columns are different.
|   |   This is because we can substitute P^T for-> P and run the proof again on that. 
|   |   This means that the rows of P are also orthogonal to each other.
|   
|   Let's further imagine that P is an orthonormal basis for the eigen vectors of A.
|   P^-1 * A * P is the digonalized matrix of A. P^-1 * A * P must be symmetric, because A is symmetric.
