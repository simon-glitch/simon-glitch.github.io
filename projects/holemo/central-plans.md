Characters (summarized):
* Holemo (main character, Pampou's wife)
* Pampou (Holemo's husband)
* Holemo's descendents:
  * Calamica - paradoxical end point
  * Synfetico - robot
  * Nebulose - lord of stars
  * Eigenshime - living void
  * Turquoise - the ocean of grievance, personified
* Licorice (Pampou's Teacher; also a friend who became his sister)

Holemo and Pampou explore the universe together, and make many friends along the way. Their main goal is to save worlds and make the lives of others better. Throughout this process, they find ways to make themselves stronger, so they can actually protect the people they love. The story is all about personal growth and perseverance. Therefore, character development is explained in great detail, and is heavily emphasized.

The fiction of the story is quite bizarre. Holemo and Pampou travel through an endless multiverse, and they have the power to literally bend reality. Some of the enemies and hardships they face are beyond human comprehension. So, this story mixes extreme fantasy with normal character development.


Holemo is a sea elf (so an elf with a dolphin's tale and inverted ear flaps).
Pampou is an squidoid (anatomically the same as the Inklings from Spatoon)
Licorice is just a human

They are all different species from different universes. They met eachother over the years, and became close friends. Eventually, Holemo decided to start calling Pampou her husband and Licorice her sister.
