>{June 10th, 2021:
    These December entries were found on a sheet of paper, titled "My Thughts, _{ by Simon Alexander }". I wrote "Alexander" instead of "Willover" for 1 of 2 reasons:
      1, a Q&A saturday by Toycat (the youtuber with the nickname "ibxtoycat") that I watched where toycat said his "last" name was "Toycat".
      2, I was going through a stage in life where I did not want my family to be a lasting part of my legacy.
    2 is too pessimistic, and the first day that I logged / wrote about states that Willover is my **sir** name, not **last** name, which means that I was following the idea from Toycat. Toycat said "Toycat" was the name he wanted to die with, and be rembered by, thus "Toycat" was his "last" name.
    My opinion on this whole matter has changed, and I don't know what opinion I want now. I think I should just understnd every opinion and where it comes from. This journal is getting long, time consuming, and almost confusing, but now I need to analyze my past.
    
    I have decided to preserve as much about the style of this document as possible

_Dec 3rd 2021_ I don't like double consenants, because they are too dificult, >{June 10th, 2021: what about double vowels? >:D } and today I stoped using the one in my name. I am only okay with ones like teammate, usua_ll_y, and boo_kk_eeper. Also, my _last_ name is 'apocalypse'. But for now, I am Simon Alexander >{ is there some kind of family acceptance issue here? }. Also, I have my own numbers: >{June 10th, 2021: see /D}
