August 1st, 2021:
    (sunday) Today was amazing beause we got to a birthday party and I went swimming. Cortni apparently realy likes us, which I've concluded by the fact that she comes here every day. I keep thinking about her, because I really enjoy thinking about people, especially the good ones.
    
    Plus, Cortni brought Noel. We all (me, Marcia, Jeanette, Samantha, Cortni, and Noel) got into the grey van, and Jeneatte drove it.
    
    We all went to Brianna''s brithday party. Before we got there, I was told it was Ashlynn's Friend's birthday party, and didn't know her name yet. We stopped at Speedway on our way there, and Cortni got slushies (aka Speedy Freezes) for herself, Noel, and me.
    Then, we went to Brianna's place. She lived on the beach, and we parked in a separate dirt parking driveway across the street.
    Now, there were a lot of things at the party that I did not have a strong understanding of, like snow cones, popcorn in weird carnival containers, 10 random cups with game numbers of on them (like 5, 10, 20, 25, etc...) as well as ID numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
    I was told it was too cold to go swimming, and didn't know the water was warm; so, I didn't bring my swimming trousers. After being informed of the water's warmness and persuaded quite a bit, I voluntarily chose to go swimming in just my underwear. Someone had placed a big raft (like a boat with no controls) out there for us to rest on / stand on / dive off of. When I got up there someone asked "who are you?" and "why are you wearing you *underwhear*?". I informed them that I am Simon, and I didn't bring my swimming trunks.
    I swam out there for like 20 minutes, and got tired / bored, so I decided to return to the shore. Everyone else followed me a minute later; I guess they like me or something. Everyone who was swimming was 7-17 years old.
    With everyone in the yard, the teenagers just started chatting about their lives, and the kids just played. I don't really understand playing; I used to play, but I always did it really mean and rude, so I won't play like that.
    
    Then, I had a snowcone (it sucked), and a hotdog (hotdogs are really good). I also tried a pretzel (it cucked too).
    
    Nana called me, asking if I wanted to go to her place, and then Papa called, asking the same thing, resummarizing their weekly plans from earlier.
    
    Noel is a 6 year old, and she is super full of energy. As soon as she was alone with me in the living room, she wanted to play, and wouldn't stop bothering me. She didn't use the word "play", but it was playing. She kept kicking me, slapping me, laughing, making farting noises, and actually farting (occasionally).
    Like a lot of kids, Noel thinks farting is funny, but its just a natural body action and its actually quite gross.
    During the day, Cortni left and Noel kept saying she wanted me to hide from her mom, and telling me to hide with her. She likes her mom a lot, but sees hiding from her as really fun. I just kept doing whatever she said, because none of it was really harmful, evil, or dangerous.
    A big issue with Noel is she likes commanding everyone a lot, and her reason for it is so justified: "When I tell my mom to do something for me, she does". Noel doesn't realize how harsh commands sound and that she has no control over others. She needs to learn that we do things for others voluntarily, either just to be nice to them, or to get paid in some way.
    
    >{August 8th, 2021:
        I just added in details about me and Noel playing Minecraft. In case you are wondering, **yes**, I am trying to say "Noel" in this library as many times as possible, because I just love her.
        Cortni parenting 9.99/10 quality.
    }
    The time reached 9:00pm, and Cortni suggested me and Noel play Minecraft. Noel tried to play Minecraft, but just wasn't used to using the controller (she didn't say that; I just know because she sucks at playing video games with it). Noel kept going into the Kitchen to bug her mom / get water (she brings her water bottle everywhere).
    Cortni told Noel to go to sleep (multiple times); eventually, Noel finally did, but she really didn't want to go to sleep.
    
    Noel also has this dog plushie named Chase Logan. He (Chase Logan, he's not a person, but Noel treats him like one) wears a dog outfit that resembles police uniforms, and Noel "takes really good care of him" according to Grandma. Noel (pretends to) shares her water with him, hugs him, pets him, and talks to him super nice.
    She is Chase's mommy and he is her baby. I guess she remembers a lot about being a baby and knows how to take care of them because Cortni took care of her so well. I asked Noel if she remembers being held like a baby and being nursed, and she sure does.
    
    I think it should be theoretically possible for a 6 year old to understand all of the essentials of civil behavior, but getting that into a person's head within just 6 years is an almost impossible feat.
    

August 2nd, 2021:
    (monday) Just hung out all day and played Skyrim. I enjoyed the day, but I kinda feel bad for not spending the day doing anything productive.
    
    Noel stayed the night last night, so I woke up with her in the room. I woke up at an early like 8:00am, and she just followed suit. Cortni brought over Noel's biking gear, but no bike. At first, I thought she said it was for some kind of skating; kids' speech is really hard to understand.
    
    Cortni finally took Noel away around noon; me and Grandma love Noel, and I actually don't mind her craziness all that much.

August 3rd, 2021:
    (tuesday) Cortni brought Noel back over here (I hardly get a break from this kid! but thats not a bad thing XD) , and also brought her bike.
    Noel wanted to ride her bike, and for me to join her; she said I could watch her or ride her scooter.vI definitely was not going to try to stand on her scooter. Noel put on her biking gear outside, insisting that I watch her so she could show my how she puts it on.
    Grandma said there were bikes in the garage, and I went in there and got Grandpa's old bike. Grandma infomed me tha tthe back room of the garage is called "the lean-to" Granpa's old bike was a bit weird, but worked, so I rode it up and down the hill with Noel.
    
    >{August 8th, 2021: I inseted this paragraph today, after realizing I hadn't described Noel's snack-water bottle. }
    Noel has always been bringing the same water bottle of hers with her. She just showed me, it has a little bottom compartment for snacks that screws on and off. Most of the time in the house, she keeps the snack compartment off.
    
    Then, Grandma said the back tire of the old bike was a bit flat, and had me find the tire pump. It took me a minute to figure out that I was supposed to find the tire pump and use it (becuase Grandma didn't immediately say that she wanted me to do so), but I found it.
    Then, VERY INTERESTING: Noel showed me how to use the tire pump on the tire.
    
    >{August 8th, 2021: It really has taken me a while to catch up on these entries, but I remember everything so well and vividly now, not just because I have loved ths last week, but also because I have better control over my mind / brain / self. }
    So, eventually Cortni told Noel to go to bed, and I was already watching *Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days*.

August 4th, 2021:
    (wednesday) I finally got to writing the rest of the July diary entries. I've been here with Marcia and Jeanette for a week, and I've just had to spend time finding myself. Really, I should always fill in the diary entries as the whole point of them is to remember how I felt, and analyze how I behave within situations.
    I have been learning a lot about myself, by being put in a new living situation; in fact, I learn the most when my life changes a lot, and lots of drastic change is healthy for me, as long as there is someone to hold my hand and accompany me. Change is too much to handle on your own; that's why so any of us fear it.
    
    
    
    I called my dad, and told hm that I would go to Nana's. Then, I lied to my dad, telling him that I would come back to his place on Wednesday (I plan on never returning to him). Grandma (Willover) wanted me to ask him if she could go over and get my clothes + my medical card.
    My dad actually answered the phone thinking I was calling from Nana's, so I told him that I had called from Marica's, me and Nana had already discussed me going to her place, and I was planning on calling her next. My dad was also super drunk on the phone.
    That particular call with my dad did not seem like the perfect time to confront my dad, so I just acted like everything was good.
    
    Then before I got to call Nana, she called me, and asked if I wanted picked up. I told her that I would love to see her, and we scheduled for her to pick me up at noon on Friday.
     
    
    It seems that in this diary, I have tried to run away from mmy feelings. Time and time again, I have temporarily (only shortly) forgotten the original purpose of this documentation. This does not necessarily need to be a perfectly autobiography of what happened; this is supposed to be about how I feel and how my mind works. I suppose that 2 months ago, I realised that my mind is flawed. Now it seems that I know all of the reasons why.
    The only thing that I fear, is that I will inaccurately describe my mind; becuase time and time again, I have tried to describe my mind to others, and been ridiculed for the impossibilty. It almost seems that my mind is different from others in an incomprehensible way.
    However, I know that the devoted among you, readers, can eventually come to a mutual understanding of my mind.
    
    Please, allow to me log my current knowledge of myself, on the next entry.
    
    >{August 10th. 2021: by the way, (Jeanette and Marcia)'s dogs obey me so well and really like me a lot now that I have been around them a lot and I really act like I am in charge of them. Even Deedee likes me; Deedee like me a lot actually. }
    

August 5th, 2021:
    (thursday) Let's start with my newfound understanding of myself: {
        
        I suspect that when I was young, I was a normal nueral network like the rest of you. But, my mother has been looking for a perfect man / husband all her life. She only ever married one man, because she will only marry the perfect man. My mother always expected their be some guy that would have lots of money and solve **all** of her problems.
        I took inspiration from my mother, and started looking for one strategy that would solve every problem in every form. For me, thinking in the astract seemed like a great soluton, so my mind invented its own idea of abstract thinking.
        My mother expected that one man would magically solve all of her problems -- what a crazy thought. I took inspiration, and hoped that I could magically solve all of my problems, and be smart and use this abstract thinking system for everything. When I say everything, I mean idea you can express with words. So, I applied the same thinking style to "conversation in a group of people" as "solving a mathematcal equation" as "thinking about myself" as "a random leaf on a tree" as "going to the store" as "the 9/11 attack". What I did was truly crazy, and because I was not born a genius, I did it the **wrong** way at  the start.
        
        The abstract thinking system started when I was about 3 years old, as the 1st memory is logged their, with full information and details. My earliest memory was my dad shovelling a path across my old front yard and me getting to walk through it. The only thing he told me was that I could walk though the path. I have always really liked shovelliing snow and snow paths. I won't get to know what else happened that day until I die and God  shows me everything. Good news: I never will need to know.
        
        By inventing my own malfformed method of thinking, I stunted myself for years, and I was very different. When I was 13, I moved in with my dad, he put me in therapy, and I began reforming my thinking. I trasnformed into a new individual, making huge leaps and bounds in psycological / mental devlopement.
        I never loved anyone until I trasnformed. Love is an interesting thing, and unconditional love seems magical. For years, my love was very conditional and fake. I never said a heartfelt "I love you too", even though my family loved me.
        I never had true empathy for others until I transformed. Its interesting that I know  entirely base my thinking on empathy.
        My transformation seems like such a simple thing; I had to learn that my previous thinking was corrupt. I never dropped my abstract thinking; I fixed it. I saw that I should understand everything within the same abstract space, but also be aware of each and every thing; awareness is important, and verbalization provides the ultimate awareness.
        
        
    }
    
    I need to never see my dad again. He insults me every day, and being around him hurts my personality. Being around him puts my self esteem in decay, and brings me to pitiful ruin.
    Nana pointed it out to me on the phone today: I am remorsing my own pity; my dad makes me feel sorry for myself!
    
    Today I met the other Corni (I will spell her name as "Korti"), and she's apparently Cortni's first friend.
    
    So, I woke up at about 8:00am with grandma, and she sent Sam to school. Then the great Cortni appeared with Noel. Cortni left; then Noel saw all of grandma's toys and wanted to have a tea party.
    Noel invited me, and she started pretending to give granma tea. Now, I'm not very good at playing, so she started feeding me water, and calling me her baby. Then noel put some of the skittles (Cortni brought a huge bag of cheap skittles and left it on our table for us) in my water, and I tasted them and they were disgusting. Noel hated them too.
    Then Noel discovered the m&m's and **asked** Grandma if she could use them; Grandma permitted it, and she put skittles in our water. She kept feeding me the M&M water, and fed grandma some, and had grandma feed her some, and gave me more. Multiple times, she **asked / requested** me to go fill up her water bottle with water (and I did, obviously).
    
    Then Noel wanted to ride on my back and have me carry her around on my shoulders. So I let her get up there, all ~40 poounds of her, and I carried her all around the house. Grandma saw me carrying her and said I need to watch out for doorways so Noel doesn't get her head bonked.
    Noel also commanded me to go outside and tried to steer me over there; I reminded her that she is **not** in charge of me, I can choose where to go, and I was already being very nice by carrying her around when she requested it.
    At about 9:45am, Jeanette got a picture of me carrying her on my shoulders, and it was just so cute. Maybe I should set the image as my profile picture or something.
    
    Kort's house => Applebees => 5 below => Walmart => Kort's house
    
    >{August 10th, 2021: thursday was quite the day, and also the last time I've seen Noel since now (wow, its been 5 days!). So, this section has the rest of thursday's events, written 5 days after they happended: }
    So Cortni was ready to leave and take Noel over to "Aunt Kort's", and Noel **really** wanted me to come. Cortni said I would have to ask my grandma if I could come with them and that it was, of course, my choice. I decided I would like to meet Kortni / "Aunt Kort" and see what else Cortni does throughout her day.
    When we were going to Kortni's residence for the 1st time, Noel was almost completely silent the whole time and Cortni was like "Why is she being so quiet? She always makes so much noise whenever we go places".
    We got Kort's apartment, and I met Kort & her son Braiden. Braiden was a pretty chill kid (unlike Noel). Noel asked to get on my shoulders again, then she started trying to steer and command me again. I remindd her once again that she is **not** in charge of me. Noel told me that Kort is her best friend (so Cotrni's best friend is also  Cotrni's daughter's best friend).
    Noel and Braiden apparently alread knew that Kort and Cortni were planning on going to *Five Below* and *Target*.
    We all went to Applebees, Braiden saw a sign with Steve *The Rock* Johnson on it and just had to point it out; Braiden said that *The Rock* is everywhere now and I noticed that he was right.
    
    
    {end of section}
    
    NO, I do not regret choosing to go with them, but it was not an ideal choice or experience. However, I did get to meet 2 new people and eat at Applebees. 2 positives at the cost of 1 long continuous negative is OK. Besides, **new** unpleasant experiences are actually helpful for my mental developement; the **same** unpleasant experience repeated many times is often detrimental.
    
    Cortni clearly understood how I felt about it and also handled it perfectly. Well, perfectly would've involved praying to God.

August 6th, 2021:
    (friday) I filled in more of the August 1st through August 5th entries. I have so much to write and so many details that I remember. My mind has evolved so much this ast week and a bit (9 days), and I just didn't spend enough of my spare time writing this all in order to already have it all written and done.
    
    NOTE TO SELF: entries can be written immediately or later; the whole point of writing them is to remind yourself of how you feel and have something to analyze later. In the future, you might forget some of the special, valuable details, and this digital document helps insure that you will be able to remeber it in the future.
    NOTE TO THE READER: I hope you can come to understand me; maybe one day your society will use my mind as a subject of study in order to develop your own minds. If you are smart enough to read these enties and understand *SOME of* theor conents, then you are also smart enough to edit your own mind to you liking, and develop as a community, not just a society.
    
    Today, Nana picked me up at noon; its now 11:41pm, and I finally understand the following quotes that Nana and my dad have told me so many times:
      = "you need to stop over-analyzing / over-thinking"
      = "you need to tell you brain to shut up"
    
    Its amazing how much new individuals can teach you if you spend a few hours with them; thanks Noel. Thanks to Nana for trying, and I am sorry to anyone else who tried to help me and I rejected them. I understand what you all meant now, and I know how it connects to my understanding of things now.
    
    I woke up at 8:00am -- extra early so that I could do mmy laundry and do anything else I wanted to to do, Grandma told me that she already had some clothes in the **dryer**, but I actually found it unwashed, in the **washer**.
    Nana and Papa took me to their place, and then we had lunch.
    
    Then Nana and Papa took me to the movies and we watched a new Disney movie starring The Rock, called *Jungle Cruise*. I remember on Sunday, Nana aked if I wanted to come to her place and watch *Jungle Cruise* with her.
    Before I went to sleep, I stayed for 2 hours filling in the August 1st through August 4th entries.

August 7th, 2021:
    (saturday) I got to go swimming today!
    
    I woke up super tired, and Nana had me water all of her plants.
    Then Nana told me **how** to clean her toilet, but didn't tell me **to do** it. I cleaned my face and brushed my teeth, but didn't clean the toilet. While I was cleaning myself, a friend of Nana and Papa showed up, and they all talked about the south wall of her huge pull barn.
    
    >{August 9th, 2021: The folllowing section of this entry was written today: }
    
    In the afternoon, me & Nana picked some blackberries; Nana told me that the black blackberries fool people by looking ripe when they are not, and I said that I could easily see the difference. As we picked berries and she explained the ripening process to me, I learned that the riper berries are squishier and come off easy, so the key to harvesting riper blackberries is to just grasp them and tug them lightly.
    
    After we finished picking berries, I mentioned that it had been a while since I last swam, so Nana arranged for me, her & Papa to go the lake.
    We went to the lake, and I was able to get in the water almost immediately because I changed into my swimming suit before we left. I took off my glasses and noticed that I almost don't need them anymore, but I still can't see things less than a foot away from my eye >{August 9th, 2021: In fact, I can see the words of the diary right now, and the font-size is only 12px (about 10pt); I still can't yet see the individual pixels, but hopefully God will grant me that ability soon }.
    I asked if Nana brought sunscreen, and she didn't, so I said we should stay at the lake for too long. I was recalling the sun burn from us not wearing sunscreen at the beach 10 days ago. >{August 9th, 2021: By the way, in the previous entries, I forgot to mention my shoulder skin that has been peeling off for the last 3 days; the sun burn I got 10 days ago was my worst ever, and it really hurt for the first 5 days of healing. }
    At the lake, their was a restaurant next to the bathrooms, and I asked Nana to buy me ice cream from their resaturant. I ordered a vanilla soft serve in a cone, but the vanilla flavor was broken, so I asked for my cone to be birthday cake flavored instead. The birthday cake tasted like lemon cupcakes / custard.
    
    Once we finally got home, Nana asked me to slice up some cheese for church tomorrow, and I accepted; Nana gave me pepperjack, moune, & cheddar-like cheese; I got confused about how much cheese I was supposed to save for her house and how much I was supposed to slice up for church. I was supposed to send 14 of each flavor to church and save 2 for house, but I initially thought I was supposed to save 14 and send 2 to church.
    I ended up eating a slice of chees I tore, and cutting all of the other 14+14+13 slices into quarters for church.
    
    I didn't even look at the diary today, let alone edit it.
    
    {section end}

August 8th, 2021:
    (sunday) Nana is sitting right next to me, telling me more about God's story. Its now 2 hours katerand she's still talking to me, trying to explain "The Lord's Prayer", which looks like it was written by the devil.
    
    So, I had individual breakfast: a blueberry muffin, some grapes, and a boiled egg. Then we all (me, Nana, and Papa) went to church (Nana and Papa have been going to this church called *Country Chapel* ever sine the COVID-19 pandemic started). We brought a bunch of food for everyone to snack on after the service (today I figured out that the church ceremony / sermon / gathering in the main chapel is called "the service").
    We brought the following foods to church:
      = grapes
      = watermelon
      = cantelope
      = crackers
      = small chess slices
      = beef sausage slices
      = venison sausage slices
      = blackberries we picked yesterday
    Maria showed up to church, and I was just happy to see her. Me, Nana, and Papa have gone on 3 walks with her.
    
    Sermons always feel like an eternity to me, because the you just sit and do nothing for 30 minutes. After the sermon was finally done, everyone recited The Lord's Prayer, and I just hated that. I quietely groaned in agony, and apparently Nana heard me.
    After the sermon everyone chowed down on the food me and Nana brought.
    
    As Me & Nana were leaving church, after we packed up all of our leftover food, Nana left her purse in the church. Good thing someone else was in their; the church was locked from the outside and purses are very important items.
    
    After we got home, Nana told me she heard my groan about The Lord's Prayer, and started a long conversation with me, trying to teach me the old language of The Lord's Prayer. I repeatedly tried to express that each translation of the bible is written by someone, and that the authors "should" be creative and express themselfves within their transaltions because their translation of the book is their book. Eventually, I made sure Nana knew that I was just upset becuase the translators didn't write in clear english.
    Nana never really tried to explain the Old English to me academically; she just told me what each individual word meant; however, she didn't define the words when "telling me what they meant"; instead, she described them in as many literal and metaphorical ways as she could come up with, and quoted more things using the words.
    
    I never mentioned it when I started writing this diary, but I love how programming has given me a great understanding of the semicolon; I can use the semicolon in my writing easily and understand it very clearly. Currently, the entire July section of the diary has 512 periods and 63 semicolons, which shows that I use semicolons frequently, but not much.
    
    Then, Papa prepared supper for us at about 4:00pm. Then we left to go to a church concert.
    The church concert was very long, and included a 10 minute sermon that felt like an eternity! At least we got cookies, ice cream sandwiches, and fudge covered ice cream bars on popscicle sticks (*what do you call them? fudgescicles?*).
    
    I added a bit to the August 5th - 7th entries, and used a lined sheet of paper to measure my penis length rather than writing diary entries. Its 7+1/4 inches if you try to not touch the base or testis, and 8+1/2 inches if you press all the way into the base.
    
    My understanding of this world truly has ascended this month, and I feel that a great revelation is coming soon.

August 9th, 2021:
    (monday) Today was suc a big day of dicovery. For starters, there is no answer to everything; if you seek an answer to everything, you should change course and seek an **understanding** of everything.
    
    I finally stopped typing at 12:10am, the next "day".

i 1/x = ln(e^( x^(-ln(0) / ln(x)) )) = ln(x)
x^(-ln(0) / ln(x)) = ln(x)
e^( x^(-ln(0) / ln(x)) ) = x




So, Nana is apparently super busy today and can't afford time to go to my dad's house and sort through all my stuff. Now, Nana also needs to talk to my dad, and school is starting soon. I plan on continuing to go to Potter's House Highschool because Nana already paid this year's tuition, so I won't return to Allegan schools.
I would like to see Adrian and hopefully go to Michigqn Adventure's with him and Mike. All in all, I won't see you today, and I don't know when I will see you next. The weekend after the 1st week of school is likely the longest you'll have to wait.
