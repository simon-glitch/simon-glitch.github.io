July 1st
    (thursday) Wow, yesterday was big! I wrote the June 30th entry today.
    I am not writing in here every day because it feels a bit tedious. I know that I should be writing here quite some bit, but I am not.
    
    Right now, at 3:35pm, I have got some flies in here. I trapped 1 fly between the window and screen, and I am leaving the other alone. I just stopped playing Hill Climb Racing to do this. Here at Nana's I have been playing a lot of Hill Climb Racing, plus some Antimatter Dimmensions, Geometry Dash, and Exponential Idle. I have been playing games so much not because I am addicted (which is what Papa keeps saying), but because I am bored.
    
    I really procastinate a lot when it comes to these diary entries. However, forgetting about them is a thing I do too.
    
    Now, for the meat of the diary, which is my psycological devlopement.
        Me, Nana, and Papa went to church today for some lessons about our founding fathers. We and some other adults, watched a video about what the founding fathers actually intended with the Bill of Rights. It turns out that the 1st amendment is not "separation of church and state". Also, almost all of the founding fathers were devout Christians who believed that religion taught us morals, and was therefore necessary for having a good country.
        ----
        I have been really mean to Nana and Papa this last week becuase I am used to my dad being mean to me. "Hurt people harm others." In fact, I have debated with myself a lot over the last month on what I want to do to / about my dad. I can't just be mean to him, and I can't get used to him being mean to me, because both of those responses lead to me learning to be mean to others. I don't want to ignore my dad becuase that is disrepectful, will hurt his feelings, and could potentially lead me to develop a bad habit of not listening to people that are displasing me in ant way.
        By being with my dad, and not getting to go anywhere else, I have forgotten what being nice looks like. Today, I shall make a conscience effort to swap back to being nice. I have spent this week remebering my past, and furthering my understanding of it. A changing environemnt has really helped, and God has helped twice as much.
        ----
        Recently, Nana has tried reading quite a few bible excepts and pieces of various separate study books, and I can not understand the English. God has told me muliple times now that the books are written that way just to challenge **me speifically**, and I will tackle them later in life. He has also told me that this physical world is filled with hints. In fact, the bible is just an attempt to summarize all of the hints and pieces in this physical world and to summarize the combined moral knowlegde of all of humanity.
        Obviously, 1 long string of text does not have the answers to everyone, **especially if said string of text was written by humans**. All humans have flaws, and nobody ever translates text perfectly. Actually, the bible is often very poorly translated becuase the translators are trying to hard t preserve every bit of the original meaning, without just writing 10 pages trying to descripe every possible meaning for a single word.
        A good transaltion involves:
          = truly rewriting the original script in a whole new unique style for the language it's being translated to
          = being **creative** in places of disgression
          = using a new tone in places where the tone of the original author is not clear
          = having grammatically correct sentances that people of the new language can easily comprehend
    
    I am finally getting to be more positive about everything, and I hope me, Nana, and Papa will get a continenal breakfast (i.e. free breakfast) at some of the motels we will stay at on your trip to Nana's dad's funeral.



July 2nd
    (friday) Today was pretty good actually. I decided that I should take some pictures of our trip.
    So, me, Nana and Papa left early in the morning and got to my dad's house.
    I repacked my cloths bag with clean clothes, and we left, me, my dad, our dog Jane, Nana, and Papa.
    
    We went to the house of Jamie (Judy's daughter), and dropped off Jane there. Jamie apparently lives in this nice trailer park, and she has one of the best trailers there.
    Then, we started our grand adventure.
    
    We went all the way over to Indiana, and hopped on I80, the popular continental highway from New York City to Las Angelos. We drove through a bit of Indiana, then Illinois, and then quite a bit of Iowa. While we were in Iowa, we visited the World's Largest Truckstop, which is was more of a mall than a truckstop. It was pretty cool!
    
    All of Iowa was amazing. We stayed at a semi-shabby motel tonight in Iowa. It was clean, but super old. Me and Nana snuck out and got ourselves some ice cream from the Casey's nearby. I think the motel was just off I80 in York (not to be confused with **New** York; ironically, New York is actually older than York ).
    
    

July 3rd
    (suturday) My dad started to get pretty grumpy today.
    
    >{ I finished this entry on July 5th, 2021 }
    We drove out of Iowa, all the way through Nebraska, and into Wyoming. Nebraska was pretty cool. We stopped at Larammie in Wyoming, and our 2nd motel was an upgrade from our 1st.
    
    At the motel in Larammie, my dad 

July 4th
    (sunday) I wrote the July 2nd entry.
    We have been on the run so much that I haven't really gotten to write in the diary. I could've pulled out the keyboard and recorded these, but my memory is good enough and I took plenty of pictures. I just started looking at the Google Maps street view of everywhere we went, and it looks very different from what I have experienced.
    
    We drove from Wyoming into Idaho today. Apparently we still have to drive a couple hundred miles through Idaho to go from Idaho Falls to Boise.
    
    >{July 5th: I finished >{July 11th, 2021:
        continued, not finished; I should always just say "next section" from here on out, becuase I often forget to write things in and remember them later.
    } this entry on the next day becuase I was busy and didn't feel like recording more. }
    We went to Nana's brother's house, and it was really nice. He had worked as a college professor of chemistry, one of my favorite fields. His wife had arthritis and the 2 of them had a little garden in their backyard. They live right outside of the city limits of Idaho Falls.
    
    Papa has really made a big deal about Nana and my dad smoking today. He really does not like the smoke or the smoking itself.
    
    On our trip, we drove through a very sparse highway in Wyoming, along the Green River, through Big Piney and Daniel (the town has the same name as my dad).
    
    We started driving up high into the mountain and came across an amazing scenic overlook. It had a short stone tower a couple hundred yards away from the road. My dad kept on telling me that I would get winded running over there becuase of the thin air, and I was winded when I **finished** running, but the thin air makes it **feel** easier to breathe for me; my dad thinks that is untrue "diarreah of the mouth", which is a phrase that him and Nana have been saying a lot on this trip.
    We then drove through the Teton Pass, along a big resovoir made by the Snake River. The Teton Pass was so beautiful and amaxing.
    
    >{ July 11th, 2021: The next section of this entry was written a whopping 7 days later: }
    On 

July 5th
    (monday) We drove from Idaho Falls to Nampa (which is just past Boise).
    
    Me and my dad walked over to Sinclair (this one had a Stinker station; apparently Stinker is a skunk franchise that commonly works with Sinclair), and got Nana and Papa some coffee. My dad started the day out super considerate.

    As we started our trip, me and my dad looked up how to get to Boise, and were told that it was only 4 hours away. *It ended up taking a lot longer than that though.* Eventually, we stopped in Burly, and got some BREAK_FAST. We went to this great restaurant with a name that is unfamiliar to me. We brought some leftover pancakes and biscuits and gravy to go with us.
    
    >{ The rest of the restaurant excerpt was written the next day, on July 6th, 2021 }
    When we got to the restaurant, Nana, Papa, and my dad started botheing me about being polite and having manners. The manners thing is something that I have always had a really hard time dealing with, becuase I hav always been punished, harrassed, and confused without any regret or empathy from the attacking party; in the future, I might discover that the "attacking party" did have some empathy or compassion, but I never *felt any!*; *I plan on getting over it, eventually.*
    
    >{ The next paragraph was written 3 days later, on June 8th, 2021 }
    After we left the restaurant, I realzed that I am much more rude now then I used to be. I decided that I should reinstantiate the decision making of the old version of myself, from winter 2018.
    
    Many streets are named after (other) towns and cities here in Idaho. The most prominent ones are Pocetello, Boise, and Twin Falls. In fact, when we were in American falls, we drove up and down Pocatello street there.
    
    On the way, we stopped at twin falls, and I followed my dad to the cliff whhere there was no fence. He started getting super frustrated at me all of a sudden, when he should have came over and tried to act like he didn't want me to fall off the cliff. However, I wasn't afraid, even though the cliff is dangerous, becuase God told me I would be fine.
    
    We continued through twin falls, with my dad taking some pictures instead of me.
    
    My dad and Nana got in quite the argument about the cliff after after we left tinws falls.
    
    My dad got so frustrated after after we left tinws falls that he decided to toss my tablet here into the back of the car. So, I didn't get any more pictures until we arrived at our 4th motel.
    
    When we arrived at Idaho City, my dad thought it was Boise! We stopped at a Sinclair (this one also had a Stinker station). I have learned throughout the trip that Sinclair and Conoco are super popular gas stations here in the west.
    
    Our 4th motel is here in Nampa. It was super nice and big. It was about as good as the last motel, and before we arrived my dad asked Nana if we could change rooms such that he would have his onw bed, and I would have my own bed.
    
    Boise is HOT in the day, because of the sun. In summmary, sun light + boise = raining fire and brimstone. I got some super good sun burn, and when we arrived at our hotel, I decided to bathe in a bit most Boise sunlight and equalize my sunburn.
    
    Then, we got our room set up at our 4th hotel and had this cool conversation with this guy in his late 50s and he apparently joined the army ballistics and got supper good at trigonometry, even though he was never a math fan in school. He now plays World of Tanks and World of Warships, which are strategic battel games with mechanics based on ballistics.
    
    >{ This entry was finished on July 6th, 2021 }
    
    I have loved the trip so far, and truly had **so much** fun. I knew my dad would eventually become a problem, and now he is.
    
    >{ This entry was *actually* finished another 2 days later, on July 8th, 2021: }
    
    Today, I reinstantiated old Simon, and I began trying to explain this to my dad, late at night, before we went to bed. I told him that I had acted up today because I didn't care about manners or his punishments. He started bothering me about how much I care about having a computer / tablet, and I told him that is something I have always cared about, but it is not my #1 priority.
    Eventually, I got to telling him that sometimes I need to be reminded to care, and the reminder only works as "Simon, you **want** to care about the feeling of others; you **want** to value them over yourself; you aren't doing that right now." Saying something like "I will take away your computer" or just smacking me doesn't help, because those cruel actions remind me of cruelty, and make me respond cruelly. I need to be reminded of treating others with kindness, and then be reminded that I care for others.
    
    My dad didn't even understand the whole *what I care about* thing.

July 6th
    (tuesday) We had or funeral today, I will write more on it tomorrow.
    
    Some important notes for future Simon:
      = Reinstantiation of old (2019) Simon (yesterday)
      = Empathy algorithm (I have been thinking about for computer since I went to Nana's; this morning I wanted to integrate it within myself)
      = changing what I cared about yesterday morning, and trying to explain it to my dad last night
      = Going to Pam's
      = my dad as a backseat driver
      = Breakfast at The Egg Factor
      = Boring and impercievable catholic celebration
      = Confusing prosession
      = Confusing graveyard
      = Some of the stories about Nana's dad
      = Kids at the buffet; realising that I should integrate more layers of empathy in my brain; beginning integration of my empathy algorithm, but in my brain.
      = If we ever do make an AI, with human understanding, it shall have 42 layers of empathy, which is much more than the less than 10 layers, and at most 19 layers that humans have.
      = Nana and my dad thought the catholic church was very rude about the communion; I don't get why
      = We should just let Papa drive, as one part of some people analysis I was doing, as I was trying to integrate more empathy layers.
      = Dad swatting the back of my head EXTREMELY HARD for shouting when there was lots of distance between us; also, my dad just shoving me and violenly waving his arms at me way too much all the time
      = Swimming in the pool with Nana and Papa before the storm (I am a lot better at swimming now, thanks to my increased intelligence and strength)
      = ----
      = Maybe we should use a more concise note list system for the diary like this; or at least provide summaries of entries along with the normal entries themselves.
    
    >{ July 8th: Here I am, the before mentioned "future Simon"; I will be leaving that summary here in this summary, but I will not be doing list summaries for every entry. So, today, July  8th, I wrote some of the entry for July 6th. }
    
    So, about 2 days into my stay at Nana's (which would be June 27th, 2021), I came up with a new method for creating an AI: using empathy. A good AI would have some kind of "empathy" and use it in all things (including physics, chemistry, pure mathematics, and design patterns). Now, today I decided that I should begin integrating such an algorithm into mmyself.
    
    We drove over to Pam's, with my dad trying to direct Papa to the middle of the street that she lives on. We didn't have her address number, and I kept trying to tell everyone that we probably couldn't find her without knowing her address. It took everyone a while to listen to me and call Pam, asking her for her address.
    
    So, we eventually got to Pam's house, and then we all went to The Egg Factory. The Egg Factory was an amazing breakfast restaurant, but they were short staffed, like every other restaurant nowadays. Yesterday, we saw a sign that said tat restaurants are short staffed becuase everyone wants to stay at home collecting unemployment and covid stimulus checks rather than going to work.
    
    >{ July 9th, 2021: I really am having a hard tiemmfinding >{ July 10th, 2021: This is a comment inside a comment; I meant to write "time finding" instead of "tiemmfinding", but I will leave the typo as a display of my *minor* dislexia. } the time to write these entries. I wrote more of this entry today: }
    
    Then we finally got going to the funeral. Nana and Papa bickered for a while, trying to find the church where the funeral is. Eventually, my dad got too annoyed by Nana and used Google Maps to provide us a route.
    
    We started the funeral by just greeting and aquainting with eachother. My dad went out to smoke and then 5 guys began carrying Nana's dad's casket into the chapel. Apparently my dad showed up late becuase he was smoking, and didn't get to carry the casket at the start even though he was supposed to carry it the whole way.
    
    The funeral had a catholic ceremony, which was beyond my comprehension in every sense. One of the pastors was this black dude with an impercievable accent. Part of the catholoc ceremony was communion, and apparently the way the pastor said it insulted my dad, Nana, and Papa. He had said that if you were catholic, you could do the communion, and that you could just be blessed otherwise.
    
    After the boring catholiv ceremony, we had a procession. A funeral procession is this nonsensical activity of everyone slowly driving to the graveyard, following the hears, with hired motorcycles on the side to stop traffic. Apparently anyone who is not "part of" the procession is supposed to just stop. Everyone who is part of the procession puts their car blinkers in emergency mode (left and right **both** flashing. In my opinion, it is very rude to do a procession becuase it haults traffic unexpectedly; we should just drive to thengraveyard normally.
    
    After everyone finished all of the speeches for Nana's dad at the graveyard, we all went to China Grand Buffet. Nana's dad's funeral money was used to pay for everyone's meal, so we all got to enjoy a luncheon. After I was done pigging out, I just started chatting with everyone and just watching everyone's interactions. There was this lady named Amanda who had 3 kids that she brought to the buffet. I watched her and her kids for most of the time; her kids were really considerate and smart.
    At the buffet, I realized that I need to integrate as many Empathy layers of empathy into myself as I can. I started justcpondering about Empathy layers. So, an Empathy layer is when you think about how someone else feels, or how something else reacts innrespect to what you do to it. Every extra layer of empathy is thinking about how person 1's feelings affect person 2, and how person 2's reactions affect person 1, and then how person's new reactions affect person 2 in a new way. Humans only ever use about 19 layers of empathy.
    A nice lady at the buffet told me how to swim in then Boise river, which a bunch of us (including me) are planning on rafting in tomorrow. Hs etold me that if I fall in I should stay calm, put my feat down stream to keep my head safe, and where a lofe vest becuase that river is a monster.
    
    As I began integrating more empathy layers into my thought process, I found that me, my dad and Nana really should just let Papa drive on his own, as my dadnhas suggested many times.
    When Nana and Papa brought me and my Dad to our motel, my dad asked if I knew where Nana's room was, and I told him that I did. I was shoutihg to make sure everyone could hear me, and then my dad decided he would swat me on the head EXTREMELY hard (it could've gotten a basketball to the hoop from the 3 point line) for making myself hearable. When I went swimming with Nana and Papa, I discovered that Nana and Papa couldn't even hear me (I wasn't loud *enough*)!
    
    Then, me, Nana, and Papa took a swim in the pool before the sun set and an upcoming storm. I am much better at swimming now, thanks to my increased intelligence (keep in mind, my motor skills, abstract thinking skills, and social skills often increase together).

July 7th, 2021
    (wednesday) Today we all went rafting on Boise River.
    
    Me, my dad, Nana, and Papa went to a park in Boise, next to the river. Then Chad drove us to a drop off point. Micheal Jones (Nana's brother) provided rafts for everyone. Nana's sisters, Pam and Kelly also tagged along.
    
    On the river I learned 
    
    Me, Nana, and Papa went to Nana's mom's home. I was informed about the home: the home used to be the manager's apartment at this studio apartment complex. So, Nana's mom's apartment is a huge apartment, while the other apartments are small little studio apartments. Nana's mom also gets a plaque on her house saying "Willie and Jane Jones" (too bad Willie is dead now).
    
    We hung out with Nana's mom ans Kelly for a while, until Kelly left, and Nana's mom gave me 2 pages of a letter she had started for me 3 years ago.WIt took me, Nana and Papa a while to find our way to Nana's mom's house. Kelly had to leave becuase she is taking a plane back to Tennessee soon.
    
    Eventually, me, Nana, Papa, and Nana's mom went out to eat. We secided to eat at Shari's, which is this amazing restaurant with the best pies ever. Our waitress, Christina was really fun and couldn't stop telling us how great Shari's pies are. Apparently Christina spent a week eating **every pie** at Shari's some time in the past; she started kn the cream pies, and then did the fruit pies; the last pie she tried was the peach perfection pie; her favorite pie was the strawberry pie.
    
    Earlier, I told Nana that I want to go swimming as much as possible. I got so full from Shari's that I couldn't eat no more. We spent an eternity there and when Nana asked if I still wanted to go to the pool, I told her I was fine.
    
    When I got to my dad's motel room he complained about his attempt at ordering Taco Bell via Uber Eats and the order being cancelled. I ordered 3 soft tacos for him after suffereing through about 20 minutes of him telling me to download Uber on his Windows computer (which is impossible becuase Uber only has apps for iOS and Android) and just singing into Uber Eats.
    My dad rejected the tacos becuase they were not supremes. He never asked for *supremes*, and instead spent most of his time saying "I'm hungry" and "download the app already". I was really sick of his stupid incompetent personality, and when I finally ordered some supreme tacos, Taco Bell never even began preparing them and the order was cancelled.
    After my 2 failed orders, my dad told me to walk to Mavericks and get him a beef burrito. I went there and bought the chicken and bacon burrito instead; I figured a chicken and bacon burrito would work just fine because my dad told me he would eat any wrap I found; apparently he couldn't eat a chicken burrito due to his lack of teeth.
    My dad was so pissed by now that I was afraid I might have to fight him.
    
    >{July 8th, 2021: Apparently my dad kept the soft tacos and the burrito in our motel room fridge for the next 2 nights. }

July 8th, 2021
    (thursday) Me, Nana, Papa, and my dad went to Nana's mom's home today.
    
    When Nana called, me and my dad woke up. My dad told me to go to thengas station and get him some coffee. I did decided to also get myself some hot chocolate. I returned and then me, my dad, Nana, and Papa went to Nana's mom's home.
    Nana and Papa have decided that we should take a ferry across Lake Michigan on our trip back home, because going through Chicago is a pain with all of its traffic. So, Papa called up a ferry company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin and made reservations for our trip acrcross Lake Michigan.
    Papa took me to AAA travel agency, but it took us quote a while to find it. It was on Cole Rd, somewhere between Emerald Ave and Franklin Ave. At AAA travel agency, we got a map of Wisconsin and a map of South Dakota.
    Now, me, Nana, Papa, and my dad went to Nana's mom's home. We spent quite some time there, picking out clothes and chatting. I got myself some hot chocolate brewed with coffee instead of water -- **great stuff!** I spent a bunch of time vibin becuase I was bored.
    I figured out that English logic can be turned into equations and algrebraic rules. It requires quite a bit of complexity, and quite a variety of symbols / relationships, but it can be done. I told Nana that English is just equations and she shrugged it off.
    
    So, after we were done at Nana's mom's house, we brought all of our newfound clothes and some of the CDs back to our motels.

July 9th, 2021
    (friday) I finished the July 6th entry, wrote the July 7th entry, and wrote the July 8th entry.
    
    >{ July 11th, 2021: shortly after leaving Boise, we stopped at the Boise Stage Stop. Apparently "Stage Stop" is another name for a truck stop. }
    
    The whole day, we could hardly see any of the mountains due to the smoke from wildfires.
    My dad was so upset for most of today.
    
    Nana tried to call my dad, but he didn't wake up. I had already been awake for a few minutes before Nana called, so I just got up, went pee, had my water, and woke up my dad. My dad demanded I prepare 2 cups of coffee for him, and we started packing up all our stuff. As we packed, my dad began tp get upset, becuase Imwas talking a bunch and wondering what was in 
    
    We got some ice cream in Swan Valley.
    
    We had a lunch picnic at the Wind River Lake. It has a fishing dock (which has sank a bit into the bank by now), 2 picnic tables, and a nice outhouse. There are also 2 small trails on the west side of the lake which are difficult to climb becuase of the slope, but not too difficult.
    
    We went through Jackson, a sprawling tourist trap just south of Teton National Forest. Jackson Town square is this cool little park with arches made of (porbably fake but still cool) horns.
    
    We traveled through Teton National Forest and got some great pictures of the Teton Mountains.
    
    Before we reached the Moran junction, the traffic suddenly slowed down becuase everyone was observing a buffalo farm. We got super close to the buffalo, and my dad leaned over like a crazy man trying to snag some pictures. I grabbed some pictures too.
    
    Then we had this funny conversation about the 1st mountain we saw in the smokeless valley:
        Papa: "bear tit mountain",
        Me: "bear teton mountain",
        Nana: "pregnant woman mountain: that's the breast, and that's the belly"
    
    
    After a while, my device got low on battery, so I stopped takign photos; my dad kept taking photos though, and he got some really great photos of the valleys leading out of the Teton Mountains.
    
    
    We finally landed in Riverton, which was a lot bigger than we thought and found a decent motel with a price less than $100 per night. My dad has decided that me and him will be staying in separate rooms from Nana and Papa on our way back, When me and my dad got in our room, I realized that I left my USB chargers and their box at the previous motel! I got really upset at my dad for letting me leave my charger at the previous motel, but he would **not** take any blame.
    
    
    
    

July 10th, 2021
    (saturday) All day I have been so anxious to finally get home. I also want to go swimming again, and have asked "is there a pool I can use?" about 6 times. I can't wait to see Adrian again.
    
    Nana and Papa woke up me and dad and we got on the road again. My dad repeatedly nagged on about "getting miles under us", which is his way of saying we should just drive without stopping a bunch of times. He always said "a couple hundred miles" or "200 hundred miles" specifically -- I wonder why he chose that amount.
    
    We got to Ten Sleep and had some breakfast burritos at cool restaurant called 1Cow. Ten Sleep has a big sign explaining the origin of its name: Ten Sleep was the intersection of 2 Native American highways, and the 4 towns on each end of the 2 highways all require 10 days and nights of travel to reach; 10 days and nights of travel is called 10 "sleeps". 1Cow sold chocalate by the mass with a scale *(no, we didn't get any chocalate)*, and it had little tire walls out front.
    
    We stopped and had lunc at a rest stop, and Nana started pestering me about manners again. I once again assumed she was trying to be mean becuase I have been taught that people act certain ways and do certain things just to annoy me. Yesterday, while we were on the highway, I was informed that people do not act confusingly just to annoy me / mess with me. I then realized that my dad has always believed it, even though he "sarcastically" tells me it sometimes. I tried to blame my dad for it, but later I realized that Nana is to blame and that it is not something I should be getting mad about.
    
    As we continued going down the highway, I really began thinking about empathy layers and my silly siimple human behavior. Humans do not usually analyze sentences for deeper meanings -- that's just a bunch of nonsense they drill into your head at school. Humans act based on their simple judgement, and can only perform analysis of things when they have learned how to analyze the specific thing. Usually, people's brains conform to specific patterns and skills, rather than being more general.
    I am very different from others, but don't think that I am saying I am some super genius or something; I am not a super genius; I have simply learned to master my own mind.
    I have learned that many things in life are hints and challenges that God has provided for me. The hints exist to help me overcome the challenges. Today I realised that many things are simultaneously hints and challenges at the same; that fact is itself a challenge to understand and a hint for *everything*.
    When people conversate, the things they say have lots of underlying meanings, and so many implications that different people will understand the words differently, even though the meaning should be consistent. I have simplified this phenomenon to certain sentences "implying" a whole bunch of extra meanng; this is just my simplification that helps my understanding; whenever I try to tell others that "do you want to take a walk with me" can imply "I am about to take a walk and you probably want to come with; if you don't take a walk with me, then you are rude and you should just take a walk with me".
    I have learned a lot of bad ideas about implied and underlyning meanings by listening to my dad's very harsh rants & comments.
    
    It is so hard to explain how my mind works; when my dad calls it stupid, and Nana calls my actions retarded, Satan really tries to tell me that the whole thing is a piece of trash & I should just be like every other human being. Well, my mind is amazing, and I am not letting everyone else get to my head. Right now, I can't think of the explanation for how I think, and the problem is that I have let the words of others get to my head.
    When people talk negatively about me, their meanings are much simpler and calmer than I take them as. I exaggerate insults, similar to how my dad exaggerates almost everything *(huh, my dad has been exaggerating a lot less than nomral while on this trip)*.
    I have tried to hard to find a deeper meaning in things, and I must instead find a deeper understanding of the existing meaning.
    
    At some point we stopped somewhere where there was a huge deer statue made of scrap metal and giant dead trees made of plaster. My dad grabbed some pictures of me and Nana sitting by them.
    
    We had dinner at a truckstop which had a "bar" instead of a "family restaurant" *(they serve many of the same restaurant purposes though)* in a samll town called Kimball. Me and dad shared a bug sloppy burger and a baked potato with shredded bacon. Nana and Papa had salad,,plus another bruger and baked potato.
    
    We stayed at West Wind Motel in Kimball. The motel is a family owned (i.e. small) business.
    

July 11th, 2021
    (sunday) When I woke up today, I displayed a super upset mood to mymdad, becuase I ammupset with the poor quality of his behavior. I really should've been nicer this morning.
    
    Me and my dad shared a bannana and then I had a sandwhich. Nana still required me to use that redundant "please" word, but I guess its not that bad.
    
    Ae drove down a boring section of highway, and after some time my dad started complaining that he was hungry. My dad was so extremely rude (as always) when demanding we get some food.
    We got taco bell and my dad gave me a taco, but I wasn't super hungry. My dad started instructing me on how to fold my taco correctly, but I didn't even want to try to eat it becuase it was so sloppy and I wasn't very hungry. I never expressed that I wasn't hungry, but instead expressed that I didn't know whether I wanted the taco.
    My dad eventually forced me to fold the taco "correctly", and left my hands covered in sauce. At this point he was really upset with me and I said "thanks for the taco, dad, but curse you for everything else".
    My dad and Nana engaged in anptjer discussion about my dad's behavior and my dad started talking about parents hitting their kids in the backs of their heads. I commented that I don't really mind being swatted (its not *that* bad), and everytime my dad swats me I just become more comfortable with it. My dad thought that comment was stupid so he swatted me, and I didn't really mind.
    My dad started complaining that I am being mouthy and I told him that I am not being mouthy and I have no respect for *punishments*. I **never will** respect punishments, becuase they are just evil, illogical, and contradictory to their purpose.
    
    I sat in the car, and began thinking. I tried to figure out how to deal with my dad, and I am really sure that I can not fix him; he is just too subvorn and selfish.
    I started trying to implement the empathy algorithm, and it all seemed so hard; I was too stressed out. So, I asked God to help me overcome my feelings 
    I tried to find out what I wanted in life, and realized that I didn't want for myself anymore. I just want others to be satisfied with my actions, This is a new want from the empathy algorithm, which has finally been implemented. I was so excited to see that the empathy algorithm actually overrid the previous purpose of life finder. I realized that I just needed to clear my head of my emotions, and I need to focus on others rather than myself.
    I took a step back from Earth, and reentered my conscience. I then gave control to the right side and felt really calm on the right. Eventaully I cleared the left too, and put the empathy algorithm at the front of my mind. I came up with a new idea on how to make the algorith high preforming.
    The new algorithm has empathy layers which can store any number of connected things, with all of the things interconnected to their neighbors and each things that is currently loaded has the empathy algorithm ran on it.
    
    The base of the empathy algorithm is simple: how can others treat me how they want to be treated such that when I treat them how I want to be treated I also want to be treated the same way they want to be treated and thus they are being treated the same way they want to be treated?
    Before today, it was slightly different: how can I change how I want to be treated such that when I treat others the way I want to be treated they will want to be treated the same way that I want to be treated and if they treat me theway they want to be treated, I will end up being treated the same way that I want to be treated.
    
    At 11:32 EST we passed a town on I90 called Adrian. Lately I have been missing my friend Adrian; at least I got to see the town "Adrian".
    
    We checked out the outside of the World's Only Corn Palace, which is a corn museum; the ouside walls of Corn Palace are covered with corn cobs, including large pictures made from multiple colors of corn cobs.
    
    We went to the 1st Casey's gas station I have seen in a while, and it was amazign as should be expected. Casey's apparently has slushies (similar to speedy-freezes), so I asked Nana to buy me one. I had mine be a mixture of all 4 availble flavors, which were the same classics at most speedways: Coca Cola, raspberry, blue raspberry, and mountain dew. Apparently a mixture of all 4 flavors together is called a sucide slushie.
    
    My dad had to go pee really bad, so we stopped at an \*emergency\* only stop on the side of a highway on-ramp. I read the asteriks on the sign and got technical and said that needing to pee counts as an "emergency" with asteriks. Nana got upset at me for being technical saying I shouldn't do that, but I should. She is just letting her feelings about {all the times I have been technical and she was annoyed} control her opinions.
    Right after we left our \*emergency\* stop, we realized that the next proper rest area was less than a mile away ( ironic! )!
    
    Around 5:30 Papa comments that someone does something about road construction jist to mess with him. I really am sick of that joke, becuase I have belidved it to be true for so long becuase I often take things literally.
    
    Truck stops are bing pointed out to me very often now; I have realised that there are a lot of truck stops along the highways usually, but I never noticed them before this trip. A truck stop is a place with gas station for both cars & semis, plus a family restaurant (or bar).
    Bigger truck stops have stores with travel items / gadgets, sleeping rooms, and even a show room.
    
    We drove right on through Minesota during the morning, and now we are in Wisconsin, which is apparently famous for cheese and dairy farming.
    
    Over time, the comments are just making the diary more and more messy; maybe it will be too difficukt for simpletons like my dad to read! Complexity as a methodmof privacy is much better than just hiding something or giving it a password.
    
    By the way, the diary is and always will be free from here on out. I will add the file to github as soon as I can. You know what's cool about Github? It doesn't delete things immediately -- it records the past, so my diary will always be here, on Github pages.
