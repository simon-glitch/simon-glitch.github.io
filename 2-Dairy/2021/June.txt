June 1st, 2021
    (tuesday) We (*me, Mrs. Kremke, Mrs. Ophoff, and the rest of our Mayterm class*) went out to Novalon Park today. It was tremendously fun.
    
    I remember throwing a frisbee into the water and I think the guy I was working with was nice enough to take it out. We also had lunch at the park, and I ate as far away from everyone else as possible while still staying close enough that I could easily walk back to the group. Yes, I remember eating alone on this occasion specifically because I am so introverted. It's astonishing I still remember this over 3.5 years later. Hmm, I wonder how many other times I remember doing things out of my sheer introversion.
    
June 2nd, 2021
    (wednesday) Today was a >{July 1st, 2021: the } final work day for our final project at school.
    
    We also had some speakers come in and we learned about the Water injustices in our world: 
      = We learned that South Africa has tap water, but its expensive, and it has have river / strem water but its not clean, and a Coca Cola is cheaper than Dasani water in India, where tap water is not availble at all.
      = We learned about 22 Liters, an organization that supplies well pumps and water filtering machines to places tht lack access to clean fresh water. The name is "22 liters" because an average human needs 22 liters of fresh water per day to live
     
    I didn't bring my computer to school, and so when I worked on my project **at school**, I just drew the layout for my Google Slides presentation. Later, when I got home, I spent hours finishing the project: doing the research, filling in the Slides of my presentation. It was a late day, but I wanted to have the best presentation.
    
    The coolest thing about my project is that I had a Google Doc (document), Google Sheet (spreadsheet), and Google Slideshow (presentation) that all linked to each other and contained the same information.

June 3rd, 2021
    (thursday) We (*me and the other students in my May Term class*) did all of our presentations today.
    
    I went 1st, and even set up the "turn in" spot for our presentations on Google Classroom, since the teacher was being slow (*no offense Mrs. Kremke*).
    
    We spent the rest of the day chilling, and watching Frozen.
    
    Mutiple times over these last 2 weeks of school (*which are being called "May Term" this year at the Potter's House High School*), Mrs. Kremke has told me that she admires the way my brain works.

June 4th, 2021
    (friday) Today wasmy last day of school. Summer vacation is here!
    At school, Ms. Kremke made us some pancakes and cooked some sauges (we hadfresh breakfast). Additionally, we finshed watching Frozen, a Disney Pixar movie, and watched the entirety of Frozen 2, which is an almost perfect movie.
    Today was a half day, so I got home at like 12:50pm, and my dad had me mow both lawns. I got really hot moowing them 2 lawns, and I emptied the lawn mower's trimmings bag 3 times! Wmptying th etrimmings bag sucks, especiall since it was overfilled every time, so I ended up taking a full bag to the backyard, and then taking the overfill on its own seperate trip.
    
    I then decided to clean up my room and fill my backpack with more tuings than usual. I decided to out surplus in my backpack just in case the need for things arose. I put my pills, my nasal spray, my nail clippers,
    After waiting at home for a while, Mike and Adrian showed up. Adrian was annoying as usual. I kept telling Mike and Adiran how much I love slushies ( ice-water slush that is flavored to be tentatively tasty ). Mike informed me that McDonald's also possesses slushies in their own food arsenal.
    
    On the way to Mkie's house, Mike and Adrian noticed an ice cream truck with a lot of popular gaming / cartoon figures, like Spongebob. I didn't get to see as much of it, because I was preoccupied with Geometry Dash. Nonetheless, I saw a glimse of the ice cream truck, and told them that I would love to get an empty clean bath tub or swimming pool one day, to buy all of the ice cream from the ice cream truck, to put all of the ice cream in the tub / pool, and then bathe / swim in the ice cream. Adrian really loved this idea.
    
    So, Mike brought us to his house, and I kept talking about slushies. Of course, me and Adiran talked about Mario and video games in general a lot more. Adrian pulled out the Wii, and asked me "what game do you wanna play first? probably Mario Galaxy". Iplayed Mrio Galaxy for a but, but got tired of it; then I played Super Mario Sunshine instead.
    
    In Mario Galaxy, I left the hungry Luma of the Garden with 1195 / 1200 star.bits, just tobe evil (I starved him >:D ).
    
    I informed Mike that Jeanette will pick me up tomorrow (saturday, June 5th).

June 5th, 2021
    (saturday) I woke up earlier than everyone else, at like 9:30am, and just chilled f9r a while.
    I played Antimatter Dimmensions and Exponential Idle without being pestered by Adrian. I also played a bunch of Super Mario Sunshine, but waited until Adrin woke up to beat Bowser.
    I also fed that hungry luma from yesterday; I promised Adrian that I would.
    
    I chatted with Jeanette on Facebook messenger and she said she would pick me and Adrian up at 1:30pm to take us to the arcade. Also, we were planning on me ditching Adrian in order to chill with Jeanette 
    
    Chriss drove me and Adrian to the arcade, but Jeanette stayed home because she was in too much pain. Me, Chriss, and Adrian really enjoyed the Arcade. I played [[ Space Invaders, Tron, Donkey Kong, Super Mario Brothers, Q-Bert, Mr. Burger, and Q-Bert agai ]] all in that order.

June 8th, 2021
    (tuesday) This is the 2nd time I am beginning a "diary", which you ARE ALLOWED TO READ.
    A "diary" is a composition of text where I write ( *or type* ) down the events of my day to day life.
    
    It is highly important that this diary contains as much personal information as possible, especially enlistings of:
      = My mistakes
      = My thoughts
      = Ways I emotionally and psycologically developed
      = Things I learned
      = The events where I was NOT aware of myself
      = The events where I WAS aware of myself
      = The things that confused me
      = My incorrect assumptions
      = My misunderstandings of words and ideas
    
    I am creating this diary for better self analysis.
    
    So, yesterday I realized and said that my current attempt at reworking my consciousness and brain "Operating System" is faltering. I have learned a lot about all of the different ways I can think, and I am confident I can improve myself.
    Today, when Papa took me to his bible study around 10am, I reverted my brain back to the old Operating System, and it is now active. As stated, I have learned a lot about thinking, which the old Operating System has integrated into itself, and I remember who I was the past few weeks.
    I was inspired by "The Good Place", a show on Netflix, to become the best version of myself. The last 4 months, I have reworked my Operating System 4 times:
      1= About 3 or 4 months ago, I created a 2nd mind, with mathematical logic, and also set up a processing cube with around 100,000,000 nuerons. The processig cube was only used a few times, and was designed for pattern processing. The 2nd mind was really good at relating abstract ideas and calculation to the real world. This mathematical logic was not designed for giving me the computations of written arithmetic, but actually made it harder for me to answer "What is 23 x 47? ". The 2nd mind made it easier for me to physical activities like Basketball, and approximating the events of real life sitiuations.
      2= About 1 month ago, I turned the left side of my brain ( *the left side of the barin controls the right side of the body, and feels like the right side to me* ) into a person ( *almost* ), which was of course, just me. The important fact is that the left side was capable of thinking, learning, and running with minimal input -- which is great for me when my right side gets tired out.
      3= About 2 weeks ago, I spent some time after school 1 day trying to come up with a new pattern that I could use to think better, to be more capable of solving difficult problems like [ [ P vs. NP ], or [ whether my dad is asking me to do something or talking about asking me to do something ] ]. The next day I found the pattern ( I can't explain what it looks like, nor draw it -- it's just an idea ). I had ONE module, which was self aware, super recursive, and capable of using the collective knowledge of the rest of the brain to make decisions.
      4= This last week, my mood worsened, and suddenly I was ( *and I am* ) having a hard time connecting to the old Simon. I could not even use the single module from {List item 3}. On May 30th, I decided to recall my past; my entire past. I recalled it all by May 30th, and spent the week thinking about past Simon.
    
    
    >{ June 13th, 2021: this second hakf was written today on June 13th, while the 1st halfwas written 5 days ago, on June 8th. }
    When I got home, I saw an email from wendi:
    |  Log on at 4:30 to my Zoom account tonight Tuesday June 8th!!!  ðŸ˜¬Send me an emoji so I know you read this. 
    |  Laryssa has an assessment to do with you.

    |  Wendi Horton
    
    * Wintery Wishes, \n \n Wendi Horton is automatically attached to Wendi's emails. She shoild *
    
    I had the meeting with Wendi and Laryssa, and Laryssa said that I might beready to graduate from Centria soon. I made sure to remind Wendi that I wanted cake ðŸŽ‚ upon graduation of Centria. I gave her a list of some cakes, whcih included coconut ( *I forgot what the rest were* ).
    
    

June 9th
    (wednesday)
    I took today as a break day, to let my brain heal; *I am not stating that it was damaged already, I am stating that it was not in perfect condition already.*
    I watched a bunch of YouTube videos, and had my meeting with Shimella, Wendi, and Elliot.
    
    
    I also had ice cream for desert tonight.
    

June 10th
    (thursday)
    
    I had a meeting with Wendi and (*someone*) today.
    
    My iClever keybaord borke all of a sudden. I made this post on Quora to try to get some help with my problem:
    {link: https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-do-I-fix-my-iClever-Bluetooth-Keyboard-which-is-compatible-with-Android-iPhone-Mac-Windows-and-Linux-Read-my-comment-for-the-details-on-how-my-keyboard-is-malfunctioning }
    |  
    
    Sadly, no one responded on Quora. I decided to email Iclever, considering that they have an 18-month replcement warranty on all smart products.

June 11th
    (friday) I had cereal for breakfast.
    Judy drove us to an Ice Cream Restaurant ( *I think this one was called "Cici's" * ), at the 44th Street and Clyde Park intersection.
    
    I vacummed the dog, Jane, for the 1st time. Jane sheds a lot of hair, which is why I will be vacuuming her regularly.

June 12th
    (saturday) I just wrote the June 4th entry, and first section of the June 5th entries.
    
    Me and Dad just stayed hoem all day. I had a delicious peanut butter and jam sandwhich for breakfast. My dad later made some corn beef hash and scrambled eggs for his own breakfast, but also made some for me.
    Me made lunch (I don't remember what it was), and he heated up leftover ravioli with marinara *like* sauce for dinner.

June 13th
    (sunday) I deleted my VitrualBlock2, Wabbitemu, and Frequncy Generator apps from my Samsung Galaxy. Also cleared the caches of most of my apps and games, since I don't use them very much. Chome had 500mB of cache!
    I just decided to also uninstall PacMan-256, even though it is a great game, because its content is always the same.
    
    Me and dad had chicken pot pies for lunch today.
    
    I wrote the June 10th, 11th, and 12th entries. I also finished the June 8th entry too.
    I like how I am writing down when I wrote each entry of this diary, but the phraseis in another entry. It makes the diary itself so much more self referential and self aware.
    
    My dad bothered me about dinner, asking if I wanted Jose's (which is aMexicsn restaurant nearby at the intersection of Abbie St and Division Ave.
    

June 14th
    (monday)
    I woke up early for my Centria assessment today. This assessment has been pre planned way ahead of time, and Centria (*ABA*) was even willing to pay for an Uber to pick us up from our house -- making the trip much more convenient.
    
    >{ This was finished on June 27th }
    However, my dad didn't want to **go** to the Centria assessment, and called them, saying that we would not do it -- they had to come to us.

June 15th
    (tuesday)
    A day of hanging out with my dad, and therefore suffering.
    
    >{ June 27: What a negative attitude about dad, right? I understand now that his brain has a disfunction. }

June 16th
    (wednesday) My dad had his meeting with Heather today
    nailuk29 on Discord asked how he could become a web developer on my IGM discord.
    This was the inspiration and moviating factor to push us into a new IGM, but I don't know what yet.
    
    

June 17th
    (thursday)
    My dad asked my to clean the windows, and started by having me help him take my window out of its frame. Then he asked me to clean the entire window -- the inside and the outside. I said I ouldn't do the inside (like the inside of the glass) because it is solid glass.
    
    I got super mad trying to put the window back into its frame. The window weighs 35 lbs and the frame is super poorly designed. My dad had to help me, and it took the two of us about an hour to get it back in, but we had to remove its bolt. We spent another hour taking it back out and trying to put it in correctly. In total, it took 2 hours to finally finish.
    My dad also wanted me to clean every other window; he said that 7 years ago, Judy managed to tak every window and clean them all in one day. Our winodws are too old and jacked for that now. 
    
    I was so aggrivated at my dad for the hour following the window cleaning. My aggrivation caused aggrivation to foster within him. He ranted at me (*I also call this him zoning out*). During these rants (*zone outs*), my dad insults me indirectly, insulting my hobbies, saying that all of my work amounts to nothing, saying that I am unsuccessul, saying that I can't do anything, saying that he onws my rights, and that I can never leave the house again.
    
    While doing the dishes, I mentioned last weekend when my Aunt said she would take me back home whenever she wanted to. My dad went crazy, and ranted at me again.
    I decided that I would set up a new operating system in my brain, which puts the real world on the inside. The idea is, my mind is reality, existing on the outside, and the world is a fantasy, a figment of my imagination, on the inside. **I went inside out.**
    
    Today there was some more work on IGM; I discrovered Ohm, a super cool JavaScript library that allows for parsing custom programming languages with custom syntax. RubenVerg said he would look into it "tomorrow".
    
    Me and dad watched most of the Conjuring, and half way through my dad got ridiculously drunk, and we went to bed.

June 18th
    (friday)
    RubenVerg totally did not look into Ohm today.
    
    My mom showed up today at like 2pm. She is crazy!
    
    I wrote the June 14, June 15th, June 16th, and June 17th entries.
    
    >{ I wrote this text on June 27th, 2021: }
    
    My dad acted like my mom hadn't taken a shower in a while, but she said she took a shower yesterday. My mom took aa shower today because she likes being clean and she likes the warm water.
    
    >{ I wrote this text on June 24th, 2021: }
    
    We *(me & mom)* did end up going to the spashpad. However, it took like 2 hours to finally get my mom to go. She kept complaining about being hot, and I told her she could take a walk, chill with me, and enjoy the cool water.
    
    >{ I wrote this text on June 27th, 2021: }
    
    I went to bed before my dad, Judy, and my mom did, Meanwhile, my mom and dad just went crazy at each other; my dad hates her.
    
    

June 19th
    (saturday) My mom was here all day. My dad couldn't stand my mom's pesence and her contant talking to the room and had to leave before he would have put his hands on her (assaulted her).
    
    Me and mom hung out all day. It was really great not having my rude (*almost evil*) dad. I mentioned that we could collect null berries or play chess.
    
    Sadly, we never played Chess. But at least we watched the 1st season of Sweet Tooth on Netflix.
    
    >{ I wrote this text on June 27th, 2021: }
    
    When my dad came back with Judy, he was very unhappy to find that my mom had repositoned some things. She put:
      the air fryer ON the counter,
      the cut out chunk of the counter from the where the sink sink was ON the lazy susan,
      the metal shelves where we keep our bowls, trash bags, and air fryer BEHIND the couch.
      the bathroom towel rack ON its bottom piece IN the basement.
    
    My mom just kept on talking and she asked my dad to hit her and assult her. She said he wan't a man and had no balls if he didn't attack her. She also called Judy a cunt >{June 27: Seriously, why do people attach such powerful connotation to this word? }. My dad had to kick her out and call the cops on her. Me, I just ignored those walking bombs (*metaphor*) and went to sleep.
    
    My mom was properly ***kicked***. >{June 27th: like kicked out }

June 20th
    (sunday) Today is "Juneteenth", a new official holliday in the US
    
    I do not yet know what Juneteenth is about.
    
    My mom showed up in the morning today. My dad decided to be nice and not call the cops on her. She asked for her phone charger, my dad told me to give it to "the bitch", and I did.
    
    It is amazing how many ridiculous names my dad gives to my mom: *"whore"*, *"bitch"*, *"cunt"*. So rude and malicious!
    

June 21st
    (monday) Uneventlful. Mostly suffering in the presence of my dad.

June 22nd
    (tuesday) Uneventlful. Mostly suffering in the presence of my dad.
    
    >{ June 27th:
        There was one day, some day from June 16th to June 23rd, where my dad told me that he had told me about an appointment I had with Wendi at 4:00pm the day before. I am 90% sure that he told me on June 21st or June 22nd.
        He also calimed that he had told me it like 4 times. I am 100% sure that didn't happen.
        I did end up missing a meeting with Wendi though, because I was busy trying to install a Geometry Dash  speed hack.
    }

June 23rd
    (wednesday)
    Judy got sick tonight. My dad is worried for her, worried that she might die or something.

June 24th
    (thursday)
    Judy was sick, so my dad left around noon. I watched a last episode of Sweet Tooth and then watched The Wish Dragon on Netflix. My mom showed up right before 3:29pm. My mom asked many times for me to let her in, but showed no violence nor threat. I told my dad, and called him on Meesenger. Then he called the cops (911) and they escorted my mother away.
    
    The cops asked my "who called?" and I told them about me messaging my dad and him calling them. The cops took my mom down to Mel Trotter's. The cops told me they would take my mom to the homeless, and my mom told which place they took her to: Mel Trotter's.

June 25th
    (friday)
    Judy was sick, so my dad left in early morning, before I even woke up. Yesterday, my dad did informed me that he would leave today, so I was fine. Me and the dog hung out on the couch, while I watched the Mainfest on Netflix.
    
    >{ The rest of this entry was written on June 27th: }
    By now, I have had a certain conversation with my dad on at least 4 different occasions.
    In this certain conversation, I try to tell him what's wrong with him, and how to fix it;
      I tell him that he should try to improve his relationship with the Willovers rather than pushing them away and hating them;
      I tell him that he has a hard time with logic / rational thinking because the main knowledge and logic request system in his brain automatically flips things to their opposites (or whatever "opposite" his brain can find);
      I tell him that he insults me too much, and verbally avuses me;
      I beg him to be a little nicer to me.
    
    I didn't have that certain conversation with my dad today, but it is an important part of my life now. >{ July 8th, 2021: I have been having it with him ever since June 8th. }
    
    Today, Nana showed up at like 2:56pm, and told me that I had an appointment today. Hhowever, she 1st started asking me about "Doctor Hart", and I thought she said "Doctor Heart". Eventually, she explained that I had an appointment with Doctor Hart sheduled for 3:00pm today.
    Then, she wanted to call Doctor Hart and tell him that she was late or something. Well, we tried to contact him, but didn't manage to.
    
    Nana took me to her house, and after some short time there, Papa made us dinner: steaks, hominy with mushrooms, stuffing, sweet potatoes, and salad. The even gave me some "brown cow" (*it's a flavor*) ice cream.
    
    I learned how my mind learns. I just absorb knowledge and information given to me, and put it in a simple relational format.
    
    I kept talking about how much I despice my dad, and how mean he is to me. In retrospect, I should really just ignore that, because apparently it's not his fault.

June 26th
    (saturday) Pretty chill day; I learned more about how my own mind learns and organizes memories. The relational format that I store knowledge in is why I am so good at analogies.
   
    It rained a ton today. We actually had a record breaking amount of rain, over 2 inches. While it was raining like crazy, we played Canasta. Canasta is a card game about picking up the pile of discards, getting on the board, and building up stacks of 7 cards of 1 kind (7 cards of 1 kind is called a "canasta"); You win Canasta by getting 5000 points, and there are lots of ways to do that.
    
    We had heavenly homemade garlic bread, green beans, brussel sprouts (which are disgusting), and lasagne. 

June 27th
    (sunday) I fixed the June 18th to=> June 25th entries. Also, I completed the June 25th and June 26th entries.
    
    We had omelettes (I only ate the bell peppers and onions from mine, because omlette egg tastes displeasing), blueberry pancakes, turkey "bacon" (its nothing like bacon), and grapes for breakfast. We had macoroni salad (but it was cooked), chicken for dinner.
    
    { This text was written on June 29th, 2021: }
    
    I talked to Nana about the last week with Judy, and got the days a bit mixed up for a minute. Thank goodness that my mom showed up on Thursday, because otherwise I would have this last week wrong. Really, how I feel and what I am thinking matters a lot more than what happens each day.
    
    
    
    { June 29th, 2021: END of edit }
    
    Me and Papa mowed the lawn, and then Nana gave me an ice cream sandwhich without Papa knowing.

June 28th
    (monday) We went to a funeral today.
    
    The funeral was for Don ??? (I really don't remeber!), and almost all of his decendants were there. The dude had 4 generations below him (all the way down to great GREAT grandchldren), which totalled to almost 100 people. After the funeral, we had a luncheon. Twice I stated that I had always thought "luncheon" was just the made up name of for the "Luncheon Kingdom" in the video game "Super Mario Odyssey". Eventually, Nana and Papa told my that "luncheon" referred to a big meal after a ceremony, particularly organized by the host.
    
    Then, I ended up getting stung by some tiny bee like insect. It got me in my right wrist, in the over 20mps wind, and left a mark that drastically changed over the day, but never hot better. At least it doesn't hurt. It looks like a rash or alergic reaction of some sort, but it is harmless.
    
    We (me, Nana, and Papa) had blueberry pancakes for breakfast. Sometime in the afternoon, Nana opened up 
    
    The rain has still been haunting us, and now we are 

June 29th
    (tuesday) I wrote the June 28th entry.
    
    It's 11:27 now, and we have almost reached the end of the  month. Monday was amazing, and it really has felt like a long time since the last entry (Sunday, just 2 days ago), because today passed the halfway mark between for my week long trip here at Nana's. We still have Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday left, but wow.
    
    On Sunday I cleaned up a lot of the journal entries, and just now I cleaned up some dates inside of my comments. I was saying "June [n]th", without the ", 2021".
    I am so hyped about making this diary. Actually, just a minute ago, the hype excited me so much I stopped and took a breather to relax. This has been a thing I have been doing for years now, stopping my mind for a moment whenever I have an epiphany or learn something great.
    
    In fact, I should take a quick detour and express some things about myself here, for the self analysis and what-knot:
      = I stop my mind at moments of great epiphany, as if I dislike pleasure, or my mind is too simple to learn at pace; actually, I often do learn physical coordination behind pace, and don't pick up on many things as early as others do; however, these mometns when I learn something are not moments that I am behind pace; it's like I am artifically putting my self behine.
      = We should note however, my brain learns better when the nuerons / sections are given a break. They need the data, and then they need T I ... M E to process it. I don't know why, but I don't learn if the learning section of brain is actively being used. Maybe if I set up a more complex brain structure I wouldn't have this problem, but I don't know.
      = I have ALWAYS been this way, however I only really started having these stopping moments after I moved in with my dad, became self aware, and started wondering things.
      = ----
      = I am obsessed with my writing. Obviously, it is important here, but I just posess the greatest desire to always choose concise, unique, and interesting words. Recently, I am realizing how humbleness (*no, not "humility*, that doesn't connotate correctly*) is super important in every aspect of life. I should be more humble in my writing; *I just realized this*.
      = ----
    
    This last week I have really gotten over my negative energy towards my dad. In my non-humble defense, my dad has exerted heaps of negative energy upon me. (*You know, these sentences have tones to them that really make a difference; I HOPE you are feeling suuume of the tone.*)
    
    I just said in the June 27th entry that how I feel matters a lot more than what happens each day. And of course, the real self analysis is in looking at the motivations for those feelings. However, reading what happened each day is good for me, as I can recall those old feelings. If you are someone else looking in, reading this diary, don't worry: I plan on revealing these feelings to you eventually. I don't just think, but **know** that my self analysis can help all humans -- *you* included.
    
    So, the rash (*Nana calls it an "Owie"*) from yesterday is still here. What's in it? I think that might have been an actual bee or wasp. The only time I was ever stung by a bee or wasp, it was here at Nana's, and Nana gave me some kind of anecdote. Maybe it was just a bee of wasp and I should get that "some kind of anecdote".
    
    Today I finally wrote out the rules for the card game I have been thinking about in my head since Sunday. I called it "Dynamic Energion", and tried to simplify it and make it much more chill than my usual games are. This game simplification feels like it links back to that humbleness idea. They are the same idea to me, just different variations. Yes, I know the difference betwen simplification and humbleness.
    
    An hour has passed now since I started this entry. That's a lot of writing! (note, I mean typing, and use them the same in this diary because they serve the same purpose; I would clarify "with a physical utensil" if it was an important detail).
    
    So, I think about my old grandpa Robert Willover a lot. He was great. I keep thinking about how my dad always hated the Willovers and insulted Grandpa. My had would say my grandpa has got diabetes because he consumes too much sugar. I kinda want to teach my dad a lesson for hating on my gandpa like that; I keep thinking I want to combat my dades evil with more evil, but I don't; I really just want my dad to shut up.
    
    Every day, my connection with God here is strengthening. In Spring 2019, I really began to believe, and >{July 1st, 2021: [then in] } Spring 2020, I started listening to God more directly. He is here all the time. I have realized that God is just everthing in the entire universe, all as one entity; I am now realizing that the sum of human knowledge and ideologies exoresses >{July 1st, 2021: (expesses) } the entire content of the bible + more + a lot of sinful stuff. If you can filter out all of the sinful stuff, then you can prosper off of that combined knowledge.
    
    >{July 1st, 2021:
        On June 29th, Nana found a toad (I keep calling it a frog!) on the south side of the other room. It hung out on the ground all day, and moved a couple of times throughout the day. It really liked its spot, and it didn't try to run away from us.
        About 2 or 3 days ago, Papa woke me up by doing the laundry in here; I don't know if he intended to wake me up, because I never asked.
    }

June 30th
    (wednesday) >{ July 1st, 2021: This whole entry was written on July 1st. }
    I checked for the frog from yesterday, and 
    
    So, today Nana's dad (i.e. my great grandpa) died. She was not too upset, because she knows that we all die eventually and that God has him taken care of. This death really is a huge change of plans.
    
    Nana's mom called Nana and told Nana about Nana's dad being dead before Nana's mom told anyone else about it. Nana is not the favorite child of her mother, so we don't have a particular reason **why** Nana was informed 1st.
    
    Nana and Papa started calling all of their doctors and told them that they wanted their appointments set back a few weeks to a month. At some point in time, Nana / Papa also called my dad at some point. Nana called some friend of hers and asked her what the motel pricing was for the area near Boise. >{July 1st, 2021: on Jule 1st, I discovered that Nana had asked for a motel with a **pool** in particular. }
    
    Nana and Papa really bickedred a lot today, agreeing that this trip is such a crazy surprise from God. Papa was really upset that we will have to miss out on Independance Day weekend (*which he called "July 4th weekend*). We did however get to see a concert at like 8:00pm, after going to Gun Lake.
    
    Apparently the plan is to drive thousands of miles to Nappa Idaho (which is near Boise Idaho). so that we can go to Nana's Dad's funeral on Monday. Also, we are bringing my dad! I really don't want to hang out with him for 2 days in a car on the way their + 2 more days in a car on the way back.
    
    Yesterday I mentioned that we heaven't even gone to the lake yet this year; *it doesn't really help when your father tells you that you can't go anywhere until July 4th; it's almost like his desires have extended to seeing his granma on July 4th.* >{ July 8th, 2021:
          I don't think what I was tryng to say here is that my dad would be breaking the rule of not seeing anyone until July 4th by letting me see his gramma, because we didn't plan on seeing her until July 5th at the earliest.
          I think that I was trying to say that maybe my dad had told me I can't leave just so that I would be able to go on this amazing trip. Which would have been sarcastic, because I always knew that my dad didn't plan for any of this; none of us knew that Nana's dad would die on June 30th, 2021..
        }
    So, Nana decided we should all go to the lake. She was originally going to go to "Sessions" Lake, but we went to Gun Lake. To our happy surprise, there was almost no people at Gun Lake.
    On the way to the Lake (with Nana driving us), I saw a Wendi's and said that I would love to have some fast food sometime (just for the unique flavor and style of fast food).
    I didn't know we were going to Gun Lake until I figured it out at the entrance where there was a teenage girl in a booth, checking people coming in. I don't know *how* she was checking* people though; sempt like she just had to glance and see.
    
    When I changwd into my swimming suit, I changed in the public bathroom, and saw someone had a bloody nose or something and had not cleaned up their mess; it really grosed me out, but I just ignored it.
    When we went in the water, Papa called me and Nana wussies because we were taking our time wading in. I eventually went all the way in, and then tried the normal alternating arm circle swimming (*I think it's called freestyle*). It actually worked, thanks to my increased intelligence. Every time I reoptimmize my brain and learn more about myself, my motor skills improve, without even using the motor skills; it's super weird and abnormal.
    
    On our way back from the Lake, we got some Wendi's: a 4-for-4 for me, and a 4-for-4 for Papa. We also got an extra chocoalte frosty (which is a cup of soft ice cream) because the employees at Wendi's are stupid. We took our food down to the summer concert at the stage in downtown Hastings. 
    
    I have discorverd that if I sit up while I have to go pee, it messes with the erection control muscle, and um, gives me an erection; very annoying!
