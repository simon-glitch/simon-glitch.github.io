## Jean Piaget

### Biographical info

Jean Piaget was a Swiss psychologist who developed with a 4-stage model of child developement. This 4 stage model is based on his theory of cognitive development and his epistemological view, which are now referred to as genetic epistemology. As a child, Piaget was interested in zoology, and even wrote about mullosks (a species that is similar to snails). Piaget became interested in studying children after he realized that they consistently answered some questions incorrectly on Alfred Binet's intelligence tests. Piaget's theories on children are therefore based on the premise that children consistently acquire certain pieces of knowledge (and understanding) as they mature. Piaget's model of child developement is essentially an organized way to describe which pieces of knowledge children are statistically likely to acquire. Piaget also had 3 children himself, and like any psychologist with children, he studied them and tested his theories on them. Furthermore, Piaget served as the *Director of the International Bureau of Education* from 1929 to 1968.
