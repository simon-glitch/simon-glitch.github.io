## Jean Piaget

### Biographical info

Jean Piaget was a Swiss psychologist who composed a 4-stage model of child developement based on his studies. Piaget's ideas have pushed our culture forward and helped parents better understand their children. As a child, Piaget was interested in zoology and wrote a few paper about mullosks (a species similar to snails). He became interested in studying children after he realized that they consistently answered some questions incorrectly on Alfred Binet's intelligence tests. Piaget was inspired by this and decided to do research on the language, and then the thinking of children. Eventually, he theorized that children acquire specific pieces of knowledge as their language matures in specific ways, and he noticed that this is somewhat consistent between different children. Piaget's model of child developement is essentially an organized way to describe which pieces of knowledge children are statistically likely to acquire, and how that knowledge is connected to their use of language. Piaget's theory of cognitive development and his epistemological view are now referred to as genetic epistemology, and is actively studied today. Piaget also had 3 children himself, and like any psychologist with children, he studied them and tested his theories on them. Furthermore, Piaget served as the *Director of the International Bureau of Education* from 1929 to 1968.

### Summary of a section of a text
* {The Language and Thought of the Child}

I've decided to summarize the 1st chapter of *The Language and Thought of the Child*. This chapter describes the results of an observational study where children were allowed to work and play as they pleased. Piaget watched 2 children, and the children around them, and observed 8 forms of speech being produced by the children: Repetition, monologue, collective monologue, adapted information, criticism, commands (and requests and threats), questions, and answers. The children spoke in monologues 5-15% of the time, and spoke in collective monologues 23-30% of the time. Considering the non-communicative, and ego-centric nature of repitition and monologues, Piaget concluded that children don't really care about being heard and enjoy talking to themselves. Piaget explained that children even play a "game" with words when they talk to themselves, where words have inherent value and usefulness all on their own, and that words don't need to be applied in a practical setting in order to be valuabe to children. These ideas are all quite common in modern culture, probably due to Piaget's influence, but I still find Piaget's writing to be inspiring.

## Quotes
> invariably imagine that they have discovered by themselves what in reality they are only repeating from a model.
This seems to be an early thought of Piaget that inspired the theory of constructivism.
