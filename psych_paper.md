## Jean Piaget

### Biographical info

Jean Piaget was a Swiss psychologist, who developed with a 4-stage model of child developement. Piaget also developed a theory of cognitive development, and an epistemological view, which are now referred to as genetic epistemology. As a child, Piaget was interested in zoology, and even wrote about mullosks (a species that is similar to snails). Piaget became interested in studying children after he realized that they consistently answered some questions incorrectly on Alfred Binet's intelligence tests.
