i use 2 different writing styles, and i use them both in multiple places:
* in my code comments
* in my commit messages
* on Discord and on other "instant messaging" apps
* in my notes
* and even in my "documentation" markdown files

The 2 styles in question have already been shown here. The 1st style is all lower case, with only capitalization on:
* capital nouns
* words that need *special* emphasis
* acronyms
    * that need emphasis
    * or that look like normal words when written in lowercase

The 1st style avoids using quotes (i.e. apostophes) in conjunctions. So "I've" becomes "ive". I very often go through and remove apostrophes or change capitalization in order to keep everything consistent.

The 1st style also doesn't end sentences with periods (`. t.h.e.s.e .`). Instead, it ends them with semicolons (`; t;h;e;s;e ;`), because many programmning languages use semicolons and sometimes the technical details have multiple closely related parts.

The 2nd style is written like normal English and follows all of the normal capitalization rules, at least as well as I know them.

I try to be somewhat consistent when I use these 2 styles. I usually use the 1st style when there a lot of technical details or when I need to make lists with a lot of items. I usually use the 2nd style when I am talking about less technical stuff, like myself or my writing style.

I am quite inconsistent at times, but I usually try to sort out paragraphs of text or sections of text into just 1 style or the other. Sometimes there is an emotional reason that I mix the 2 styles together or use 1 style rather than the other.
