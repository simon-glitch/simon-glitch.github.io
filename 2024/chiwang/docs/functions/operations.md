Like other types, the `Function` type supports multiple operations.

Let `f`, `g`, and `h` be functions.

Let `x`, `y`, and `z` be any type.

# Composition
`f * g` is `f` composed with `g`
* `(f * g)(x) = f(g(x))`

# Coupling
`f + g` is `f` coupled with `g`
* `(f + g)(x) = (f(x), g(x))`

This can be repeated, to make a longer tuple.
