# Built-ins
Most of the built-in types have lower-case names. Some of them have upper case names, usually because there is no reason to use them, or because they have static methods that are more useful than the constructor.

For example:
* `Function` is capitalized because its lower-case version is used to declare keyword functions
* `Object` is capitalized because its constructor is not needed in type declarations and it has a lot of static methods
* `Type` is capitalized because its lower-case version is a built-in function that does gives the type of an object
