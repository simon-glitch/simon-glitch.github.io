  <body><h1 id="king-taco">King Taco</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>King Taco is a card game that I conceived of in my 8th-grade year, around 2018 or 2019. The card game's design draws inspiration from other card games, such as Exploding Kittens, and Unstable Unicorns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grammarly says these rules take about 15 minutes to read, and 30 minutes to orate. Grammarly also says that reading this has a difficulty of around a 7th-grade reading level. </p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>My original goal with King Taco was to invent a complex and exciting (perhaps even <em>rivetting</em>) strategic card game. I love randomness and combos. I also like to allow players to build up strength over multiple turns, but I don't like games with simple numerical strength, such as Yugioh. Thus, the main idea of this game was to create lots of complex, unique, and interesting cards which foster innovation and adaptation by the players.</p>
<p>The rules are written in great detail, with lots of clarifications, in order to avoid confusion. Players are also given the freedom to do things conveniently and quickly, in order to avoid wasting time. In fact, the whole point of this game is to be simultaneously high-action, fast, and complex (but not complicated) all at once.</p>
<h3 id="cyrptic--dollar-signs-">Cyrptic $ Dollar Signs $?</h3>
<p>I use dollar signs to make my writing more clear. Imagine I say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have $A, and I won't just give $A to any charity foundation which says that they want $A.
Where $A is my garage with all of my power tools in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could have said this instead (and this would have has the same meaning as the sentences above):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have <strong>a garage full of power tools</strong>, and I won't just give <strong>my power tools</strong> to any charity foundation which says that they want <strong>the power tools</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this document, there is a lot of complex terminology like "player's turn", "the player who goes after", "the player who played the 1st card", and so on. <strong>In the future, I will try to remove all of the cryptic dollar signs</strong>, but for now I am going to leave them as is. Writing out definitions and making terminology for each and every little thing is a lot of work, and the dollar signs save me some of the hassles, <em><strong>OK?</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="the-card-piles-intro">The Card Piles (intro)</h3>
<p>First, we start by questioning the standard design of card games. Instead of having the typical system of 2 card piles, we will have 3 piles. These piles essentially work as a main draw, a main discard, and then a hybrid pile. However, to avoid confusion, we make them locations, such as the Restaurant, the Garden, and the Warehouse.</p>
<ul>
<li>We also give each player a fridge, an oven, and a trashbin.<ul>
<li>When a player uses a card, it goes to the pile where their trashbin is located.</li>
<li>When a player draws a card, they draw from the pile where their fridge is located.</li>
<li>When a player discards a card or dismisses a Crepeture they put it in the pile where their oven is located.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(the difference between using a card and discarding a card is explained later in this document)</em></p>
<p>Like a typical card game, each player has a hand. A player's hand is limited to 10 cards. Excess cards must be discarded at the end of their turn. If a player ($A) is given excess cards during another player's turn, $A can keep the cards until the end of $A's turn; if $A ends up being skipped, this means that $A could potentially hold onto a large number of cards for a long time.</p>
<p>Having a lot of cards is not necessarily a good thing though: players need to actually get their hand to 0 cards in order to win unless they use some kind of special trick.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-win">How to Win</h2>
<h3 id="the-carmelized-crown">The Carmelized Crown</h3>
<p>For simplicity's sake, winning in this game is not complicated at all. There is a card called "The Carmelized Crown" (also referred to as "the Crown").</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At any point in time:</strong> if a player currently has the Crown in their hand, they win the current round of the game. The player can simply show the face of the Crown (or their whole hand) to everyone in order to verify that they have it.</li>
<li>The crown should always be kept face-up in a location where every player can see it. A player may not pick up the Crown during play unless the player is taking a break.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attaining-the-crown">Attaining the Crown</h3>
<p>When a player has 0 cards in their hand, at the beginning of their turn, they <strong>must</strong> draw 1 card from the pile of seasonings. (Cards drawn from the pile of seasonings are always drawn 1 card at a time.) Every time the player draws a Blank Seasoning, they must:</p>
<ul>
<li>discard the Blank Seasoning (into the Seasoning Discard Pile)</li>
<li>draw 1 seasoning card again</li>
<li>if there are no seasonings left in the pile, the player can take the Crown (and thus win)
The player must then place the seasoning face-up on the table, anywhere next to their Crepeture Bed.
The player must now begin drawing preferences from the pile of preferences. The player starts by drawing 1 preference card. (<em>just like with seasonings</em>) Every time the player draws a Blank Preference, they must:</li>
<li>discard the Blank Preference (into the Preference Discard Pile)</li>
<li>draw 1 preference card again</li>
<li>if there are no preferences left in the pile, the player can take the Crown (and thus win)
Now, (if the player doesn't have the Crown) the player must put the Preference face-up next to their Seasoning.</li>
<li>If the Preference and Seasoning match (i.e. they have the same "matching number"), the player may take the Crown.</li>
<li>If the cards don't match, then:<ul>
<li>The player must take the pile of preferences, and search for the Preference that matches their Seasoning. That Seasoning and its matching Preference must be put in the game box (i.e. removed from play).</li>
<li>The dealer must shuffle (face-down) all of the preferences in play.<ul>
<li>After shuffling the preferences, the dealer must put the preferences (face-down) back in the pile of preferences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The dealer must also shuffle (face-down) all of the seasonings in play;<ul>
<li>if any player {who is not currently in Turn} had a seasoning in their hand, they must:<ul>
<li>show the card face-up to everyone</li>
<li>and then give the card to the dealer (before the dealer shuffles the seasonings)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After shuffling the seasonings, the dealer must put the seasonings (face-down) back in the pile of seasoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terminology-special-terms">Terminology (Special Terms)</h2>
<p>This section explains the basic terminology of card games in general. This explanation should apply to other card games as well, but every game has its own unique rules. Therefore, this explanation doesn't necessarily apply to all card games.</p>
<h3 id="face-up--down">Face up / down</h3>
<p>"face up" and "face down" are both adjectives. They can be used with hyphens (like-this: face-up), and they can be capitalized at the beginning of sentences and inside of titles, just like other words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine that a card is face-up. The term "face-up" essentially means that the face of the card is "visible".</li>
<li>Imagine that a card is face-down. The term "face-down" essentially means that the face of the card is "hidden" or "invisible".</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="draw">Draw</h3>
<p>The word "draw" means "take the top card". So, imagine the current player draws from a specific deck (I'll refer to this deck as "the deck"):</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically, the player must take the top card of the deck and put it into their hand. While doing this, the player should try to respect the face-down nature of the card and prevent any other player from seeing the face of the card. Of course, once the card is in the player's hand (i.e. it is parallel to the other cards in the player's hand), the player can feel free to look at the card as much as they want to.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other terminology in this game has a lot of specific rules that pertain to this game in particular. So, it is all explained in the <a href="#specific-terminology">Specific Terminology</a> section of this game.</p>
<h2 id="specific-terminology">Specific Terminology</h2>
<h3 id="taking-a-break">taking a break</h3>
<p>Taking a break is a pretty common thing to do when playing any game. If [1 or more] players are taking breaks at unreasonable times or are taking breaks for too long, you might decide to create some house rules on taking breaks. Some simple examples of house rules for taking a break are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a break may only last for 3 minutes (180 seconds) or less;</li>
<li>a player may only take a break once in every hour</li>
<li>a player must discard 1 card before taking a break; let's refer to the player who is deciding to take a break as "P1".<ul>
<li>The player may say "I'm taking a break" and will then be allowed to discard 1 card, even if the player is not In Turn.</li>
<li>If another player (called "P2") believes that P1's break might have benefited from discarding the card, then P2 can forcibly give a card to P1, in an attempt to disadvantage P1. Only 1 card can be forced into P1's hand for this reason, <strong>per break</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I should remind you that the bullet points above are only <strong>EXAMPLES</strong> of house rules that your player group could adopt. You are not obligated to follow the rules in those bullet points, <strong>unless</strong> your group decides to include them as house rules.</p>
<h3 id="take-have-own-attain">Take, have, own, attain</h3>
<p>In this game, the word "have" when applied to the object "card", means "hold [the card]" or "have [the Crepeture] in [the player's Crepeture Pen]". The same logic applies to "owning [a card or collection of cards]" and "possessing [a card]". The words "take" and "attain" are used to refer to: the action of moving a card into a player's hand, or the action of moving a Crepeture into the player's Pen.</p>
<p>The player also "has" a Fridge, an Oven, a Trashbin, and a Crepeture Pen. The Fridge, Oven, and Trashbin act as indicators of where the player draws from and discards to. A player's Crepeture Pen is an additional container for the player's cards (as the name implies, it exists specifically for the player's Crepetures).</p>
<p>Finally, a player "has" any face-down cards that are placed next to or under their Crepeture Pen. In fact, all face-down cards next to or under a player's Crepeture Pen <em>should</em> be part of the player's hand, and <em>should</em> be treated as such when performing the effects of cards.</p>
<h3 id="give">Give</h3>
<p>See <a href="#giving-cards">Giving Cards</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hands">Hands</h2>
<p>Just like most card games, every player has a hand. A hand is a collection of cards which the player is allowed to use. Many cards have unique conditions for when and how they are used.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, there is no limit to how many cards a player can possess. However, if a player is currently in Turn, they may not end their turn if they currently have more than 10 cards in their hand. Some clarifications on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a player has more than 10 cards in their hand, they may discard 1 card.</li>
<li>if a player just discarded a card, they may not use any card in their hand (other than the NOPE card), and they may not play any Crepeture from their hand.</li>
<li>a player may not discard a card, UNLESS:<ul>
<li>(during their turn) they have more than 10 cards in their hand</li>
<li>OR a card's effects or some other rule <strong>requires</strong> them to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hand-privacy">Hand Privacy</h3>
<p>A player can look at the cards in their hand as much as they want to. A player should always try to hide their hand from other players. A player can hide their hand by keeping it close to them. A player can also put their hand face-down on the table in front of them; in which case, the hand should be close to their Crepeture Pen. The player should make sure that the Crepeture pen is not actually covered though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If players are having an especially hard time hiding their hands, then they can try to use covers. A cover would be a section of cardboard (or another flat surface) with 2 folds that separate the section into 3 parts. These covers allow the player to surround their hand. This obscures the hand from almost every angle of view except for the player's specific seat.
<em>You can also have a cover that's specifically designed for covering the garden while a player inserts a card into the garden.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I should clarify that when a player takes a break (or stops actively holding their hand for any reason), they should make sure to leave their hand face-down on the table, thus hiding it.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"hide their hand" means "hide the faces of the cards in the player's hand".</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="giving-cards">Giving Cards</h3>
<p>Players may not "trade" cards with each other for any reason beyond following the effects of a card. This is not <em>Monopoly</em> and this is not a Free Market economy either.</p>
<p>However, some card effects do force a player (who we'll call "P1") to give cards to another player (who we'll call "P2"). When P1 gives a card to P2, P1 should make sure that no one else can see the face of the card. The card's backside MUST be visible, and other players are allowed to ensure that P1 is giving the correct number of cards to P2. If you only have 2 players, then you can feel free to give cards face-up, since both players will have seen the faces of the cards anyways.</p>
<p>If a rule specifically says to give a card "face-up", then:</p>
<ul>
<li>P1 and P2 must keep the card face-up until it is in P2's hand.</li>
<li>P1 and P2 can keep the rest of their hands face-down.</li>
<li>If other players want to, they can ask P1 to show the card to everyone <strong>first</strong>, before giving it to P2.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-many-decks-and-piles">The Many Decks and Piles</h2>
<p>There is one main deck of cards. The cards in this card have a label on their front and back sides saying <code>(main deck)</code>.</p>
<p>There are also 2 other, much smaller decks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The seasonings, which have the label <code>(seasoning)</code></li>
<li>and the preferences, which have the label <code>(preference)</code>
The purpose of these 2 decks is explained in the <strong>How to Win</strong> section.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main deck consists of 121 unique cards. If you have any duplicate cards, remove them, and consider contacting us (we don't anyone to be missing cards or to have to sort out duplicates). If you like the duplicates being duplicated, you can leave them their <em>, I guess, but I advise against that!</em></p>
<p>The cards have a lot of different effects with a lot of different rules, which are covered mostly in the <code>Effects</code> section and the <code>Crepetures</code> section.</p>
<h3 id="the-warehouse">The Warehouse</h3>
<p>At the start of the game, the main deck is placed in the Warehouse. Whenever the Warehouse is empty (i.e.) there are no cards on it, the current player will have to refill it. To refill the Warehouse, the player must follow these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>pick up all of the cards from the Restaurant, and make them face-down.<ul>
<li>if the Restaurant is empty, then pick up the cards in the Garden, and keep them face-down</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>now, shuffle the cards, face-down. <em>Before play begins, the host can opt for the dealer to shuffle instead</em></li>
<li>(keep the cards face-down) make sure they are shuffled really well, and place them face-down on the Warehouse</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if the current player has less than 5 cards in their hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>and the current player has already drawn:<ul>
<li>they can draw 1 more card;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and the current player has not drawn yet:<ul>
<li>they can draw 3 cards!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-restaurant">The Restaurant</h3>
<p>The cards in the Restaurant must be kept face-up at all times, except for when a player is rearranging the cards (keep reading). If a player wants to, they can rearrange cards in the Restaurant <strong>whenever they want to</strong>, as long as they don't move any cards from the Restaurant into their hand, and as long as they are not being too distracting. The player should have their own hand face-down, on the table in front of them, while they are rearranging the cards in Restaurant. The player can look at the cards in the Restaurant, and should not try to get an advantage by hiding the cards from any other players.</p>
<h3 id="the-garden">The Garden</h3>
<p>The cards in the Garden must be kept face-down at all times.</p>
<p>If a player turns a card in the Garden face-up without permission, I suggest that you punish them by burying their legs in the ground in the nearest available location with suitable soil for doing so. <em>However, that's just a suggestion, not an actual rule.</em></p>
<p>Whenever a card is added to the Garden, by using it, discarding it, or dismissing it, it must be shown face-up to all of the other players. Let's refer to the player who is putting the card in the Sower as the Sower. The card that will be added to the Garden is called the Seed. The Sower must insert the Seed into the Garden. The Sower may not place the Seed on the top, or the bottom of the Garden, unless there were less than 2 other cards already in the Garden. The Sower can actually pick up the Garden and put it somewhere no one else can see it, in order to prevent people from knowing where the Sower is putting the Seed. The Sower may not turn any card in the Gardne face-up such that the Sower can see the card's face. The Sower can even count cards as they insert the seed, in order to place the Seed exactly where they want to.</p>
<p>These complex rules for how new cards are added to the Garden mean that players can know which cards are in the Garden, and even have an idea of where the cards are. However, players oftentimes won't know exactly where each card is, and that is what makes the Garden fun (in my opinion at least)!</p>
<h2 id="house-rules">House Rules</h2>
<p>If you want, you can vote on some house rules before play begins, or have the host decide on some house rules. This is not <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, but I'm also not going to stop you from having your own house rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A house rule is any rule that is determined by your group of players. House rules can override any of the rules listed in this manual. House rules are included in the term "the rules in/of this manual", and should be respected just like the rules of this manual.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="cheating">Cheating</h2>
<p>"Cheating" refers to any action that violates the rules in this manual or on the cards in this game. If a player cheats, the host decides which punishment to enact for the player. <strong>I hereby grant you permission to make any punishment that is legal according to the laws of your country and that is acceptable according to the moral &amp; ethical standards &amp; norms of your culture.</strong></p>
<h2 id="removal-of-a-player">Removal of A Player</h2>
<p>Furthermore, if a player is being particularly annoying or disruptive, you can have a vote to remove the player (this vote is also called rem-trying the player). All players and the host are allowed to vote, except for the player who is being rem-tried. As long as 2/3 or more of the voting members vote in favor of removing the player, the player will be removed from play (and banned from playing with the other players until further notice is given by the host or some other qualified authority).</p>
<p>After a player is removed, the remaining players are required to vote on whether to continue Play. If the players unanimously vote in favor of continuing Play, then play will be continued. However, if any player disagrees with the act of continuing Play, then the current play is canceled. When the current play is canceled, no one can win the current play (i.e. the current round of the game), and players must decide whether they would like to restart Play.</p>
<h2 id="in-turn">In Turn</h2>
<p>In most card games, the players take turns doing things. If the current turn is a certain player's turn, we can say:</p>
<ul>
<li>[that player] is currently in Turn</li>
<li>it is currently [that player]'s turn</li>
<li>[that player] is the current player</li>
</ul>
<p>If that player is named Leesha, we can say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leesha is currently In Turn</li>
<li>it is currently Leesha's turn</li>
<li>Leesha is the current player</li>
</ul>
<p>Let $A be the current player. Let $B be the player who "goes after" $A. When $A's turn ends, $B's turn begins, unless someone has the Crown in their hand.</p>
<h3 id="who-goes-first">Who Goes First</h3>
<p>Feel free to use your own method for determining who goes first.</p>
<p>When you start Play (i.e. start playing the current round of the game), the current turn will be the turn of the player who "goes first".</p>
<p>I suggest that you use this method for determining who goes first:</p>
<ul>
<li>have the host choose a card from the main deck (we will call this the Chosen Card)</li>
<li>the host will choose a temporary dealer</li>
<li>the temporary dealer will shuffle (face-down) all of the cards in the deck, and place the deck face-down in the Warehouse</li>
<li>now have everyone decide where they want to sit<ul>
<li>if there are any disputes on who sits where, the host can settle the dispute; if the players don't let the host settle the dispute, they are banned from play!</li>
<li>play should go counterclockwise (i.e. to the right) because that's objectively "right" (just kidding; have the host decide which direction play will go in)<ul>
<li>if the seating arrangement is too confusing, the host should write down a list of everyone's names, in order, such that:<ul>
<li>the player who is placed after another player on the host's list also goes after that player during Play</li>
<li>i.e. the host's list is the order of play</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if you use the counterclockwise order of play, then:<ul>
<li>for any player $A, the player who is seated to the right of player $A is the player who goes after $A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>now, players will begin drawing cards<ul>
<li>if the host is also a player, have the host draw first; the host will draw 1 card from the deck;<ul>
<li>if the host is NOT a player, then the host will choose which player draws first; the host may NOT choose for the dealer to draw 1st</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>every time a player draws</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="who-is-the-host">Who is the host?</h4>
<p>The host is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the owner of the building you are in,</li>
<li>the person who is currently responsible for taking care of this section of the building</li>
<li>the person who invited everyone else to the building</li>
<li>the person who is renting this section of the building</li>
<li>the oldest person</li>
<li>the most trusted person</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, you could even use an anonymous vote to determine who the most trusted person is (and have them be the host).</p>
