  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been prevalent for decades. Its prevalence in modern society keeps growing, and the methods of treatment keep improving. The Autism Cares Act (ACA) only took 7 months (from February to September) to go through legislation, and was one of the last bills signed by former President Donald Trump during the 2016-2020 presidential term. The ACA provided "$369.7 million" in funding per year, from 2020 to 2024; this totals $1.848 billion in funding, all of which is delegated for the research and treatment of ASD (in the US) ([36] Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee).
  
  Children with ASD (CWAs) experience a great difficulty in the act of communication; it's so great that they are offered various interventions and special education services. These services are intended to level the playing field and give them a chance at `integrating` into society. About 15% of all public school students (aged 3 to 21), which is approximately 7.2 million students, receive special services from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), para. 1). Approximately 12% of those students are diagnosed with ASD (NCES, Figure 1). One can multiply the 7.2 million by the 12% to find that around 860,000 children with ASD are served by IDEA [^³].
  
  "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental disorder associated with the presence of social-communication deficits" ([30] O. Ousley & T. Cermak, Abstract, para. 1) (see `Definition Summary` section of this paper to learn more).
  
  
  One day, the author was curiously thinking and pondering about sign language, and had a realization. Sign Language is somewhat unpopular, but could be used a lot more. The field of study on ASD has a lot of active exploration and development. Sometimes the solution to a problem is to try something new. So, perhaps Sign Language could be used to help solve some communication difficulties for some children with ASD. Sign Language could help CWAs who are too sensitive to sound, CWAs who are inattentive to oral speaking, mute CWAs, and CWAs with speech impediments. Sign Language could also help CWAs who prefer to use their hands or prefer multimodal intervention over single-modality intervention. (This is discussed in more detail in the Sign Language Can Help section of this paper)
  
  The research on Sign Language being used to help CWAs (SLHC) might seem sparse, considering that many studies only focus on one subject (here, 'subject' means client / individual with ASD) ([35] Schreibman et al., Support ... Treatments, para. 1). Nonetheless, there is a large amount of research which has shown that Sign Language could significantly improve the communication and language skills of many CWAs.
  
  Before one can analyze the evidence for this and make an educated inference, one needs to understand the subject matter better.
  /\ this is a transition to the history section
  
  
  The US currently spends "more than $265 billion" per year on "care" for individuals with Autism. This amount is even projected, by some researchers, to be as much as "$1 trillion" in 2050 ([81], Predicting Autism Risk in Infancy, para. 1).






History

1817
  
  "French physician Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard described Victor the Wild Boy of Aveyron, a young boy who was found after being isolated in the woods for 11 years, as being socially withdrawn in addition to having language and intellectual disabilities" ([28] C. K. Cook & A. Willmerdinger, page 1). In 1817, Itard wrote a paper about stuttering.
    Stuttering is not an official symptom of ASD listed in DSM-V , however, it has been associated with ASD for a long time (because stuttering is a communication-related problem). Also, crutch words like `um`, `ah`, and `you know...` are not considered stuttering ([44] APA 2014, Vol 45, No. 7, para. 1 & 2).
  
1911
  In 1910, Paul Eugen Bleuler, a Swiss psychiatrist, used the word 'autism' ([28] C. K. Cook & A. Willmerdinger, page 1).
  
  In 1911, he coined the word, defining it as "the most severe cases of schizophrenia". Bleuler described autistic children as having a tendency to imagine "fantasy worlds" and distract themselves from "unsatisfying realities" ([27] B. Evans, Abstract, para. 2).
  
1938
  Hans Asperger began studying ASD around 1938. The disease that Asperger studied was called `Asperger's Syndrome`; the syndrome was reclassified as ASD of severity level 1 in DSM-V, on May 18 of 2013 ([45] S. Hosseini, M. Molla, Excerpt, para. 2). Asperger did lots of troubling studies of ASD throughout World War 2, but his work isn't really relevant anymore ([46] H. Czech, Abstract: Conclusions, last para. / para. 14).

  
1960
  ([27] B. Evans, Abstract, para. 2)
  In the mid 1960's, autism was redefined such that it was greatly differentiated from schizophrenia; "the autistic child has a deficiency of fantasy rather than an excess" ([27], B. Evans, Abstract, para. 2). Bonnie Evans argues that "the change in the meaning of autism" could be "part of a more general shift in Anglo-American psychiatric reasoning".

  
Approx 1960
  ([28] C. K. Cook & A. Willmerdinger, page 2)
  The understanding continued to evolve, with Bruno Bettelheim's theory on "refrigerator mothers".
  ([28] C. K. Cook & A. Willmerdinger, page 3)
  Bettleheim claimed that ASD was caused by emotional and psychogenic factors, and blamed mothers for having poor parenting. Bettleheim tried removing the CWAs from their parents, as a method of intervention; In 1964, Bernard Rimland debunked Bettleheim's theory, and proved that autism is primarily caused by genetics, not by poor parenting. However, poor parenting (in general) does have various negative affects on children. Furthermore, when CWAs have parents who can provide the CWAs with more invention time, they tend to experience less disability ([54], Discussion, para. 4). "Parental, family, and caregiver support" helps children and youth cope with lots of things. This includes "adversity, especially if they encounter stigma or prejudice associated with factors such as their race/ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, weight or socioeconomic status" ([53], Coping with Adversity, para. 1).

  
1965
  ([28] C. K. Cook & A. Willmerdinger, page 4)
  Around 1965, Ole Ivar Lovaas bega developing a set of ideas that would eventually become Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).
  
1969
  According to Edgar Carr and others: Many researchers believed that CWAs could not use a "system of communication", until around 1969. In 1969, researchers discovered that "chimpanzees could be taught to use sign language". After that, "[a] number of clinicians wondered whether other nonverbal organisms, such as autistic children, could also be taught to sign" ([37] E. Carr et al., 1978, page 1).
  This quote shows a pessimistic view on ASD. Researchers held a false belief about the capabilities of CWAs. CWAs are definitely human and humans clearly use at least 1 "system of communication" (arguably multiple of them). Therefore, CWAs should not be referred to as "nonverbal organisms", and no one should be unsure about whether CWAs (in general) can use a "system of communication".
  
1980
    In 1980, the "Trend Towards Increasingly Naturalistic Behavioral Interventions" began. At first, researchers tried using "child-preferred activities" and materials, "incidental teaching strategies", the "reinforcement of approximations and communicative attempts", more direct treatment in natural contexts. ([35] L. Schreibman et al., Trend Towards Increasingly Naturalistic Behavioral Interventions, para. 1). All of these different strategies of intervention are forms of ABA ([35] Schreibman et al., Trend Towards Increasingly Naturalistic Behavioral Interventions, para. 2).
    In 1982, Laura Schreibman and others ([63] Laura Schreibman et al., Abstract) released a paper, which descibed an important aspect of "Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions" (NDBI). Schreibman et al.'s paper was about teaching CWAs to respond to the use of multiple cues at once by their therapist. Since then, some other papers have been made on NBDI.
  
1987
  In 1987, Lovaas published a paper on his revolutionary study on autism treatment. Lovaas found that, with years of intense reinforcement, children with autism could improve, and even learn to function as members of society. This paper caused a "paradigm shift" away from just getting CWAs under control, and towards helping them with interventions ([31] S. Rogers and L. Vismara, Abstract, para. 2).
  
 1998
    ([28] C. K. Cook & A. Willmerdinger, pages 3 & 4)
    Then, in 1998, Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a scientific paper, suggesting that vaccines for Rubella, Measles, and Mumps could cause autism. The paper claimed that the vaccines had thimerosal, and that thimerosal caused autism. The paper was taken down in 2010, and the athors admitted that their research was done incorrectly ([65], *no section title, para. 4) and there is still no conclusive proof that vaccines cause autism ([65], para. 2).


Definition Summary
  ([29] C. Lord et al., Introduction, para. 1)
  "In the past 50 years," the common understanding of "autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has" changed drastically. Originally, ASD was "a narrowly defined, rare disorder of childhood onset"; now ASD is a "well publicized, advocated, and researched lifelong condition, recognised as fairly common and very heterogeneous".
  
  From the previous section, one can conclude that: the definition, the understanding, the practiced treatment, and the held mindset of ASD have all evolved significantly throughout the past century ([66], Abstract, para. 1). The DSM-5 is a well-trusted reflection of this evolution. The active and on-going research in the field of study on ASD is also quite significant ([68], Abstract, para. 1). The world's understanding of ASD will continue to evolve going into the future, and this is a reason for many people to be excited about the "future" of ASD.
  
  According to the DSM-5, a child is diagnosed as a child with ASD (CWA) if: the CWA has "Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts". The 1st context is "social-emotional reciprocity". The 2nd context is 
"nonverbal communicative behaviors" (such as gestures). The context listed area is "developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships" ([64] DSM-5, page 50).
  
  The DSM-5 summarizes the symptoms of ASD as such ([64] DSM-5, page xlii): the symptoms of ASD "represent a single continuum of mild to severe impairments". The impairments are "in the domains of social communication and restrictive repetitive behaviors/interests rather than being distinct disorders". The word represent is used to simplify the complexity of an individual instance of ASD. ASD is used as a plural, `Autism Spectrum Disorders` (ASDs), because each individual with ASD can have (often does have) a unique ASD of their own.
  
  ASD is no single problem, and is not just 1 disorder. The spectrum captures a lot of different symtoms and behaviors. The DSM-5 goes to great detail in explaining how therapists should provide unique treatment for each of their unique clients with ASD.
  
  In stark contrast to ASD, Sign Language is much more specific and singular in its definition. Some early scholars claimed that "signed language" was "a universal human language", or "the native language of man" ([8], Introduction, para. 2). Some people define Sign Language as "a visual communication system", which uses "gestures" and "facial expressions", to express "thoughts" and "convey meaning" ([1], page 1). However, Sign Language should not be confused with gesture, or with emblems, because the 3 forms of manual communication are all different.
  
  ([35] L. Schreibman et al., Historical Context, para. 1)
  "applied behavior analysis (ABA)," can be defined as "the science of understanding how changes in the environment affect human behavior". Ivar Lovaas was a pioneer in the study of children with autism; he and other scientists believed that most children with autism experience too much difficulty in acquiring "skills from the natural environment"; the scientists thus claimed that children with autism need reinforcement training; often times, they would use terminology like "operant learning" or "discrimination paradigm", to describe the children's need for reinforcement learning. These terms are also used to describe reinforcement training for dogs and animals.

  ([35] Scheribman et al., Early Developmental Perspectives ..., para.1)
  Infant and child development is a very important topic in the research of ASD. During the 1980s, and 1990s, "research on infant and child development" increased drastically. Researchers noticed that CWAs needed help with skills that are "precursors to language development, such as joint attention". The observation that "infants are active 'hypothesis-testers' who learn by forming and testing predictions on their environments" caused researchers to realize that CWAs would benefit more from active therapy. Finally, researchers realized that (1) "affective exchange" (AE) was required for social motivation, (2) CWAs had a deficit of AE, and (3) AE between CWAS and their therapists would benefit the CWAs significantly.

Transition
  The most important general idea behind ABA, AE, and NDBI is that they focus on individualized therapy which is attuned to the CWA's specific case of ASD (see footnote [^¹]).

Untested Possibility
  Sign Language could create new opportunities for some CWAs to feel more engaged with their therapist. The visual aspect of Sign Language could also allow therapists to analyze CWAs from a new linguistic perspective. The new insights that could arise from the adoption of Sign Language, not just as a side hobby, but as a mainstream form of communication, could be capaciously momentous.




Sign Language Can Help
CWAs Who Benefit
Proof
  Sign Language is a perfectly valid alternative to orally spoken language. In fact, approximately "92% of young people" in the UK believe that Sign Language should even by taught in public schools ([6], Introduction, para. 3). Studies have proven that infants (without ASD) can learn Sign Language, and adults can learn it too. Some studies have even shown that CWAs can learn Sign Language ([83], page 2). Considering how Sign Language has helped the deaf communicate with eachother, one could hypothesize that Sign Language could help children with ASD (CWAs) as well. There are (at least) 4 different groups of CWAs, all of which could experience benefits.

A short study found that CWAs had improved language skills after learning Sign Language (for 2 CWAs out of a sample of 3) ([83], page 2).

    Firstly, quite a few CWAs are extremely sensitive to sounds (misophonia or hyperacusis). "Patients with ASD [tend to] have a comorbid SPD in 80-90 percent of cases" ([56], Introduction, para. 1).
    Secondly, there are some CWAs who tend to pay very little or no attention to sounds. CWAs who are extremely sensitive to sound might be too frightened or terrified for them to be able to interact with their therapist (via the oral modality). Both the over sensitive CWAs, and the sound-ignoring CWAs might benefit from use of Sign Language. Thirdly, there are mute CWAs, who might be able to hear just fine, but rarely or never actually use the oral modality. Fourthly, there are CWAs with speech impediments, who are hard to understand, due to their inability to pronounce words correctly (or their difficulty in achieving the proper pronunciation of words). Both the mute CWAs, and the CWAs with poor pronunciation skills could use Sign Language to improve their ability to communicate with their therapist(s).
  
Move to `Sign Language Can Help` section
  Anyways, Edgar Carr et al. was also emphasizing an important new idea:
    ([39] D. Nunes, page "18" (actually page 2))
    One can "[hypothesize]" that manual communication would be easier to generalize to non-treatment settings". There is no proof or evidence that the manual modality can't be used for all general purposes.
  
  
  How Sign Lang could be used as a coping mechanism. Having an ability to communicate is good for mental health (provides an outlet). Helps them learn.
  
  
  Now, `responsely activities` are "learning activities which are responsive to [the learner's] preferences and needs or modes". "When students participate in a range of cognitive and social" `responsely activities`, they tend to experience more effective learning. Multi-modal learning is thus a well-researched method of teaching, allows educators to "shift their emphasis from the delivery of instruction to the engagement of their learner" ([50], page 37).
  
  
Gesture
  For some CWAs, after learning and using Sign Language, they might be able to learn & understand gestures better; even though gesture and Sign Language are not the same as each other. Sign Language might be especially effective as an early intervention, even though infants with deficits in leaning language (who typically are diagnosed with ASD a few years later) often have a hard time learning gestures. The difference could actally become a benefit to the CWAs. Gesture can be taught naturally for typical children, and Sign Language can be taught via interventions for CWAs. When infants with a typical aptitude for communication learn gesture, they tend to learn speech just a few months afterward. The CWAs might be able to start developing strong communication skills, just a few months or years after learning Sign Language.
  
Foreign Language Comparison
  The act of learning Sign Language could have many more benefits for CWAs as well. The learning of a forgeign language has been shown to improve language skills in general, for the learner. Thus, a person who learns Sign Language could be expected to see similar benefits. The current research on this is not extensive enough to make this claim certain. However, research has shown that infants benefit from learning Sign Language; [cite specific study] found that infants experienced a significant benefit to their language skills, as late as 96 months after learning Sign Language. The implications of this research are truly immense (see `Beyond ASD` for more on this). With all of that in mind, one can deduce that, for some CWAs, the learning of Sign Language could improve their writing skills and their ability to communicate in the oral modality.
   
Face Masks
  Face masks were used a lot during the CoViD-19 (a.k.a. SARS-CoV-2) Pandemic. Face masks impede both oral language and Sign Language. Oral Languages are harder to hear when a face mask is covering the mouth and nose. Sign Language depends on a lot of facial expressions, which are greatly obscured by many face masks. Signers (people who Sign Language) found transparent masks to be easier to use for communication ([82], Abstract, para. 1). There are no studies on which form of communication is cleaner / better (as far as face masks are concerned). Therefore, the author of this article will simply propose the following claim. Sign Language and oral language are, probably, equally valid forms of communication for people to use while wearing face masks.
  
Transition from `Beyond ASD` to `Clarifications`
  The actual addition of Sign Language, into the clinical environments which CWAs tend to inhabit, would involve a lot of complexity. Considring that only 500,000 ([72], page 13) of 
([78], page 7, table 2) US citizens in 2006 new Sign Language, one can say that Sign Language usage is extremely scarce. In fact, the proportion of US Citizens who new Sign Language in 2006 could be interpreted as a p-value; that p-value would have a z statistic of 2.934; an IQ test is typically based on a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 ([79], 2.1. Estimation of General Cognitive Ability, para. 2). Applying the z score, 100 + 15*z = 144 IQ. So, the percentage of Americans who know sign language is approximately the same as the percentage of Americans who have an IQ above 144; these 2 percentages are each approximately 0.17%, or 1 in 600. One could also say that knowing Sign Language is just as rare as being a genius.

Clarifications
I keep learning new things throughout the research process.

Autism Might Not Be Prevelant
  The prevelance of ASD (i.e. the measure of how many individuals can be diagnosed as individuals with ASD (IWAs)) is very difficult to measure. Different statisticians and researchers use all kinds of various methods, and means to measure the prevelance. The evidence shows that when parents and teachers are asked to answer survey questions, the prevelance is often overestimated ([67], 3. Factors Potentially Affecting Prevalence, last para. / para. 4).
from 0.8/1000 in the North, Sirajganj district of Bangladesh to 93/1000 in Japan ([67], 4. Discussion, para. 2). However, a similar argument could be used to state that ASD might be much more prevelant in many places.


Language Is Just Difficult to Learn
  CWAs, by definition have difficulty with using language (this paper, Introduction). So, one could reasonably expect that many CWAs might not be very receptive of Sign Language. Some mute CWAs could be equally mute after learning Sign Language as before learning Sign Language. Some CWAs might prefer the oral modality over the manual modality. Some CWAs might confuse Sign Language with gestures. There are might even be some CWAs who feel threatened by Sign Language. They might state something similar to `the excessive movement of the signers hands is too agressive`.
  
The Cost of Learning Language
  Furthermore, attemption to teach Sign Language to the CWAs (TSLTTC) could slow down their acquisition of language in the oral modality. Also, the time and money cost of actually trying to TSLTTC might not be worth the rewards. The number of CWAs who actually learn Sign Language might end up being ultimately insignificant. There could be extra stress and burden for the care takers of the CWAs. This stress could reduce or nullify the benefits that the CWAs experience from learning sign language.

  So, teaching Sign Language is not gauranteed to be beneficial for 100% of CWAs. However, many papers and studies in the past have provided strong evidence that many CWAs will benefit from learning Sign Language. Unfortunately, those many papers don't actually prove much about SLHC, and some would even say there is "relative little research" on the topic ([62], page 90). Realisticaly speaking, CWAs should be tested to see if Sign Language would benefit them. Sign Languages should merely be offered as an option, rather than forced as a rule. Of course the IDEA does this anyways. Organizations like Applied ABC are founded on the principle of offering "individualized care" ([60], Our Approach, para. 1). Therapists won't force CWAs to do things that the CWAs can't do.
  ^1: IDEA is "designed to meet their unique" ([59], IDEA Purpose, bullet 1).

Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions
  // continuing from this (old History) and this (History ASD):
  
  As was stated earlier in this paper, children (in general) learn more effectively in multimodal environments and from multimodal constructions (such as audio which is accompanied by visual aids). Visual aids increase the rate of learning retention for the students, and cause students to be more attentive to the course content. Visual aids also improve student's understanding, help student's broarden their vocabulary, and make the content seem more pertinent to the students ([61], "Significance of the Research", bullet points).
  
  Sign Language uses facial expressions, and therefore might allow some CWAs to feel like they are having a more personal and emotionally intensive interaction with their therapist. Furthermore, some CWAs can't stand paying attention to audio cues and work better with visual cues. Considering these

  In summary, AE is more effective because it allows for the child/client to be more engaged with the therapist. Considering that fact, Sign Language might be more effective than the oral modality; especially when the CWA has a speech impediment or APD. There's not really any research that specifically focuses on this; but, children have been shown to learn much more effectively when their specific strengths & weaknesses are accounted for.

Early Interventions
  Interventions for CWAs are more effect when done at an earlier age ([81], Predicting Autism Risk in Infancy, para. 2). Research indicates that the ideal age to begin inverventions is around 3 years, 9 months, and 22 days of age ([80], Conclusions, para. 1). About 50% of CWAs are diagnosed until they 6 years of age, and the evidence shows that they would benefit from an earlier diagnosis ([81], Predicting Autism Risk in Infancy, para. 2).



Hearing Aids
Hearing Aids help people with partial loss of hearing, by amplifying sound waves ([74], What is a hearing aid?, para. 2). Some hearing aids are specially designed for specific sounds and frequencies, according to the patient's specific hearing loss. Typically hearing loss is experienced for mostly high frequencies ([75] What Is Hearing Loss? The Simple Answer ..., para. 2); many hearings aids are consequently designed to specifically amplify high frequencies. Special hearing aids have be used on children with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). In the experiment, the children were able to understand the speech of other people much better. Therefore, hearing aids could be helpful for many children with ASD. Combining the hearing aids with sound cancelling or dampening headphones could very well improve the communicative abilities of many CWAs. This is especially true of CWAs who are too sensitive to sound, and CWAs who are mostly dismissive towards sounds (i.e. CWAs who have a hard time paying attention to sounds).






Beyond ASD
  Remember, Sign Language should not be confused with gesture (more information on this can be found in the Clarifications section, [GET NUMBER HERE]-th paragraph.
  
  Teaching Sign Language to infants and children has been shown to help their development of language skills. "36-month old infants using sign scored almost a full year ahead of their average peers;" even 5 years later, they still "averaged 12 points higher in IQ than their non-signing peers". ([1], page 5)
  Early diagnosis and treatment of ASD is ideal. Considering that Sign Language could have many benefits for CWAs, many other children could also benefit from it. Considering that diagnosis of ASD in infants can be very difficult 
  Many toddlers and other young children are prone to throwing a "temper tantrum". This is often a "result of a feeling of frustration because they are not able to verbally express themselves". Sign Language could remedy this by providing an intutive, easy-to-learn means of communication. ([1], page ?)
  


  "Learning another language is a life goal for many. We generally think that doing so is a form of self-improvement" ([6], Introduction, para. 1). Sign Languages are rarely ever taught ([6], Introduction, para. 1). 

Sign Language for Everyone
  Old people often have difficulty learning a foreign language, but age is not the only factor that determines aptitude. Studies have shown that "neurogenetic makeup, higher-order cognitive factors, language experience, age-conditioned learning styles and motivation" are also important factors ([58]). A vast majority of hearing loss is experienced by older persons. "Age is the strongest predictor of hearing loss" ([22], bullet 5), and "50 percent of those who are 75 and older have disabling hearing loss" ([22], bullet 10).





"In the US, there are 28 million Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing people ..., and ASL is the primary language for an estimated 500,000" ([72], page 13). This equates to about 1.8% of adults in the US who use Sign Language as their primary language.

"an unadjusted 2.8% of adults in the USA reported sign language use" ([71], page / para. number unknown, due to paywall).


## The Hard of Hearing
  and learning a new language can be difficult for older persons ([9], Foreign Language ... Older Individuals, para. 2). Older persons could benefit from learning Sign Language, but they tend to do so less often than young people do ([73] Abstract, only para.). Fortunately, total deafness is quite rare <^D>(), even among older persons <^E>(). Therefore, many people could use hearing aids instead of Sign Language.
  Extrapolating further, hearing aids could also be used to help CWAs, and could even work as an alternative to Sign Language (read more in the `Clarifications` section). Still though, older people ARE capable of learning a new language, and Sign Language (when adapted for the native culture and language) is arguably much less foreign than other orally spoken languages. Thus, Sign Language could be very useful, even though there is a perfectly valid alternative to Sign Language.

//      * for each of the different items / parts of text that you would like me to support with citations:

  So, teaching Sign Language is not gauranteed to be beneficial for 100% of CWAs. However, many papers and studies in the past have provided strong evidence that many CWAs will benefit from learning Sign Language. Unfortunately, those many papers don't actually prove much about SLHC, and some would even say there is "relative little research" on the topic ([62], page 90). Realisticaly speaking, CWAs should be tested to see if Sign Language would benefit them. Sign Languages should merely be offered as an option, rather than forced as a rule. Of course the IDEA does this anyways. Organizations like Applied ABC are founded on the principle of offering "individualized care" ([60], Our Approach, para. 1). Therapists won't force CWAs to do things that the CWAs can't do.

Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions
  // continuing from this (old History) and this (History ASD):
  
  As was stated earlier in this paper, children (in general) learn more effectively in multimodal environments and from multimodal constructions (such as audio which is accompanied by visual aids). Visual aids increase the rate of learning retention for the students, and cause students to be more attentive to the course content. Visual aids also improve student's understanding, help student's broarden their vocabulary, and make the content seem more pertinent to the students ([61], "Significance of the Research", bullet points).
  
  Sign Language uses facial expressions, and therefore might allow some CWAs to feel like they are having a more personal and emotionally intensive interaction with their therapist. Furthermore, some CWAs can't stand paying attention to audio cues and work better with visual cues. Considering these

  In summary, AE is more effective because it allows for the child/client to be more engaged with the therapist. Considering that fact, Sign Language might be more effective than the oral modality; especially when the CWA has a speech impediment or APD. There's not really any research that specifically focuses on this; but, children have been shown to learn much more effectively when their specific strengths & weaknesses are accounted for.



Hearing Aids
  Hearing Aids help people with partial loss of hearing, by amplifying sound waves. Some hearing aids are specially designed for people who have good hearing, but still have a hard time hearing certain sounds. Such special hearing aids have be used on children with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). In the experiment, the children were able to understand the speech of other people much better. Therefore, hearing aids could be helpful for many children with ASD. Combining the hearing aids with sound cancelling or dampening headphones could very well improve the communicative abilities of many CWAs. This is especially true of CWAs who are too sensitive to sound, and CWAs who are mostly dismissive towards sounds (i.e. CWAs who have a hard time paying attention to sounds).

APD
  As David Moore points out, APD might be limited to just "secondary APD" and "acquired APD". The "secondary" APD is genetic, and the "acquired" APD is caused by a severe injury or an infection ([76], 'HISTORY, ANCIENT, AND MODERN', only para.). "Children diagnosed with APD perform equally to children diagnosed with [other learning and behavioral disorders]" ([77], Abstract: Conclusions, only para.). Therefore, APD might be a unique disorder, or it might be more of a symptom that is experienced as a result of other disorders and events.












Conclusion
  One should remember that ASD is a behaviorally defined neurological disorder.
  
  Sign Language could benefit many different groups of people. The idea that Sign Language could improve the communication abilities of CWAs has a lot of merit. Sign Language may not be for everyone, and different CWAs have very distinct and specific needs. Nonetheless, the utility of Sign Language seems pertinent and applicable to the interventions of many CWAs.

  The implications of teaching Sign Language to CWAs could be epochal and revolutionary. The potential for a more intuitive way for people to learn a foreign language is undeniable. There is a real possibility that Sign Language might cause any form of learning to become multimodal, and improve cognitive abilities.

  One should remember that Sign Language is a perfectly valid alternative to orally spoken language. Each individual with ASD requires an individual diagnosis and specialized, individualized care. Ultimately, this means that Sign Language should be considered for adoption and implementation as part of the interventions for children with ASD.

  // the `clarifications section does a lot of work clarifying things, and the history of ASD doesn't need to be recapped. So, I think the paragraphs above are a great summary to remind the reader of the significance of Sign Language and its ability to specialize in individual therapy.




Footnotes
^¹: ASD
  Typically, researchers and experts refer to Autism as "Autism Spectrum Disorders" (as a plural) ([62], page 90) ([69] C. Lord, no section title*, para. 1). This is done in order to better represent the unique and individualized aspect of the different diagnosis that different IWA are given. The key point here is that each IWA has their own unique instance of ASD. The acronym `ASD` refers to 1 or more occurrences of Autism Spectrum Disorders, where there are 1 or more individuals who experience the symptoms of those disorders. The acronym `ASD` is often used as a singular, with verbs like "is" and "has". This is true because `ASD` often refers to `the (one, single) group of all Autism Spectrum Disorders`.
  
^²: IWA
  IWA refers to 1 individual who experiences the symptoms of their specific Autism Spectrum Disorder. Researchers and experts prefer to use the term "individual with ASD" rather than "autistic individual". "IWA" is preferred because the word "autistic" is associated with various stereotypes, and it doesn't foreground the fact that every individual has a unique case of ASD.

^⁴: Sign Language, Gesture, and Emblems
  * This is a bit of a side tangeant;
    Sign Language puts words together in a categorical structure, and the individual words tend to have simple, categorical meaning. For example, there is no single sign for "find food". A signer might say just "food", because the conversation was already focused on finding things in general (and one can combine the context of finding with the sign for "food" to get the phrase "find food"). Given no context, a signer can combine the sign for "find" with the sign for "food" to get the phrase "find food". ([4], {7.3. Which ... location, para. 2; 8. Conclusion, para. 1}).
    Gestures are heavily depenedent on context and (by definition) don't make sense without context. For example, a pointing gesture typically "that is the thing that you are looking for; I hope that you will find it useful, given the context of this conversation, for accomplishing whatever you just said that you want to do". Pointing can also mean "I need you to do something to that, so I can do something else", and the 2 actions are implied or given by the context of the conversation. Furthermore, pointing is (probably) so common in everyday speech because of how long the alternative, spoken sentence is. Who wants to state some 30 or 40 word sentence when they can just point (and, potentially, say "that")?
    Most of the gestures that are not pointing actually require the user to speak, and thus aren't worth noting.
    Many people believe that emblems are gestures, but they are not. An emblem is a very specific hand movement, with a very specific (typically simple) meaning. The most common examples are the emblems for: `yes`, `no`, `stay`, `go/leave`, `come`, `hello`, `silence` ('shhh...'). Emblems are clear enough that a vast majority of animals can be trained to respond to them. Emblems don't count as gesture because society has specific rules that determine whether the emblem is correct or incorrect. For example, waving up and down (i.e. rotated 90 degrees) is incorrect, and will not be seen as the user saying "yellow". Pointing at one's own face for the emblem "come here" also doesn't work. Many listeners (including many dogs) will not interpret that as "come step on my face", nor "put yourself in physical contact with my face". Many people will think that the user is trying to show a zit or express an emotion, rather than deliver a command. ([1+i] Gawne & Cooperrider, pages 1 and 2);
