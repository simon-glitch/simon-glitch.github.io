                Disorder (ASD) has been prevalent for decades. Its prevalence in modern society keeps growing, and the
                methods of treatment keep improving. The Autism Cares Act (ACA) only took 7 months (from February to
                September) to go through legislation, and was one of the last bills signed by former President Donald
                Trump during the 2016-2020 presidential term. The ACA provided "$369.7 million" in funding per year,
                from 2020 to 2024; this totals $1.848 billion in funding, all of which is delegated for the research and

                field and give them a chance at `integrating` into society. About 15% of all public school students

            <p dir="ltr" class="lh-s mt mb "><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt NTall v-bl w-p ">&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, the
                author was curiously thinking and pondering about sign language, and had a realization. Sign Language is
                somewhat unpopular, but could be used a lot more. The field of study on ASD has a lot of active

                believed that most children with autism experience too much difficulty in acquiring "skills from the

                skills that are "precursors to language development, such as joint attention". The observation that
                "infants are active 'hypothesis-testers' who learn by forming and testing predictions on their
                environments" caused researchers to realize that CWAs would benefit more from active therapy. Finally,
                researchers realized that (1) "affective exchange" (AE) was required for social motivation, (2) CWAs had
                a deficit of AE, and (3) AE between CWAS and their therapists would benefit the CWAs

                typically are diagnosed with ASD a few years later) often have a hard time learning gestures. The

                extensive enough to make this claim certain. However, research has shown that infants benefit from

So, one could reasonably expect that many CWAs might not be

                before learning Sign Language. Some CWAs might prefer the oral modality over the manual modality. Some

                attempting to teach Sign Language to the CWAs (TSLTTC) could slow down their acquisition of language in
                the oral modality. Also, the time and money cost of actually trying to TSLTTC might not be worth the
                rewards. The number of CWAs who actually learn Sign Language might end up being ultimately
                insignificant. There could be extra stress and burden for the caretakers of the CWAs. This stress could
                reduce or nullify the benefits that the CWAs experience from learning sign language.</span></p><br>
            <p dir="ltr" class="lh-s mt mb "><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt NTall v-bl w-p ">&nbsp;&nbsp;So, teaching Sign
                Language is not guaranteed to be beneficial for 100% of CWAs. However, many papers and studies in the
                past have provided strong evidence that many CWAs will benefit from learning Sign Language.
                Unfortunately, those many papers don't actually prove much about SLHC, and some would even say there is

                Realistically speaking, CWAs should be tested to see if Sign Language would benefit them. Sign Languages
                should merely be offered as an option, rather than forced as a rule. Of course the IDEA does this

                rate of learning retention for the students, and cause students to be more attentive to the course
                content. Visual aids also improve student's understanding, help students broaden their vocabulary, and

                uses facial expressions, and therefore might allow some CWAs to feel like they are having a more
                personal and emotionally intensive interaction with their therapist. Furthermore, some CWAs can't stand
                paying attention to audio cues and work better with visual cues. Considering these</span></p><br>

                more effective because it allows for the child/client to be more engaged with the therapist. Considering
                that fact, Sign Language might be more effective than the oral modality; especially when the CWA has a
                speech impediment or APD. There's not really any research that specifically focuses on this; but,
                children have been shown to learn much more effectively when their specific strengths &amp; weaknesses

                could benefit many different groups of people. The idea that Sign Language could improve the
                communication abilities of CWAs has a lot of merit. Sign Language may not be for everyone, and different
                CWAs have very distinct and specific needs. Nonetheless, the utility of Sign Language seems pertinent
                and applicable to the interventions of many CWAs.</span></p><br>
            <p dir="ltr" class="lh-s mt mb "><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt NTall v-bl w-p ">&nbsp;&nbsp;The implications
                of teaching Sign Language to CWAs could be epochal and revolutionary. The potential for a more intuitive
                way for people to learn a foreign language is undeniable. There is a real possibility that Sign Language
                might cause any form of learning to become multimodal, and improve cognitive abilities.</span></p><br>
            <p dir="ltr" class="lh-s mt mb "><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt NTall v-bl w-p ">&nbsp;&nbsp;One should
                remember that Sign Language is a perfectly valid alternative to orally spoken language. Each individual
                with ASD requires an individual diagnosis and specialized, individualized care. Ultimately, this means
                that Sign Language should be considered for adoption and implementation as part of the interventions for
                children with ASD.</span></p><br>

                researchers and experts refer to Autism as "Autism Spectrum Disorders" (as a plural) </span><span class="fs-12 f-cn bt NTall v-bl w-p " style="color:#d9006c;">([62], page 90)</span><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt NTall v-bl w-p "> </span><span class="fs-12 f-cn bt NTall v-bl w-p " style="color:#d9006c;">([69] C.

                individualized aspect of the different diagnosis that different IWA are given. The key point here is
                that each IWA has their own unique instance of ASD. The acronym `ASD` refers to 1 or more occurrences of
                Autism Spectrum Disorders, where there are 1 or more individuals who experience the symptoms of those
                disorders. The acronym `ASD` is often used as a singular, with verbs like "is" and "has". This is true
                because `ASD` often refers to `the (</span><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt Hw Nall v-bl w-p ">one,

                individual who experiences the symptoms of their specific Autism Spectrum Disorder. Researchers and
                experts prefer to use the term "individual with ASD" rather than "autistic individual". "IWA" is
                preferred because the word "autistic" is associated with various stereotypes, and it doesn't foreground
                the fact that every individual has a unique case of ASD.</span></p><br>

                Language puts words together in a categorical structure, and the individual words tend to have simple,
                categorical meaning. For example, there is no single sign for "find food". A signer might say just
                "food", because the conversation was already focused on finding things in general (and one can combine
                the context of finding with the sign for "food" to get the phrase "find food"). Given no context, a
                signer can combine the sign for "find" with the sign for "food" to get the phrase "find food".

            <p dir="ltr" class="lh-s mt mb "><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt NTall v-bl w-p ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gestures are heavily dependent on
                context and (by definition) don't make sense without context. For example, a pointing gesture typically
                "that is the thing that you are looking for; I hope that you will find it useful, given the context of
                this conversation, for accomplishing whatever you just said that you want to do". Pointing can also mean
                "I need you to do something to that, so I can do something else", and the 2 actions are implied or given
                by the context of the conversation. Furthermore, pointing is (probably) so common in everyday speech
                because of how long the alternative, spoken sentence is. Who wants to state some 30 or 40 word sentence
                when they can just point (and, potentially, say "that")?</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr" class="lh-s mt mb "><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt NTall v-bl w-p ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
                of the gestures that are not pointing actually require the user to speak, and thus aren't worth
                noting.</span></p>
            <p dir="ltr" class="lh-s mt mb "><span class="fs-12 f-cn c bt NTall v-bl w-p ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
                people believe that emblems are gestures, but they are not. An emblem is a very specific hand movement,
                with a very specific (typically simple) meaning. The most common examples are the emblems for: `yes`,
                `no`, `stay`, `go/leave`, `come`, `hello`, `silence` ('shhh...'). Emblems are clear enough that a vast
                majority of animals can be trained to respond to them. Emblems don't count as gesture because society
                has specific rules that determine whether the emblem is correct or incorrect. For example, waving up and
                down (i.e. rotated 90 degrees) is incorrect, and will not be seen as the user saying "yellow". Pointing
                at one's own face for the emblem "come here" also doesn't work. Many listeners (including many dogs)
                will not interpret that as "come step on my face", nor "put yourself in physical contact with my face".
                Many people will think that the user is trying to show a zit or express an emotion, rather than deliver
                a command. </span><span class="fs-12 f-cn bt NTall v-bl w-p " style="color:#d9006c;">([1+i] Gawne &amp;
