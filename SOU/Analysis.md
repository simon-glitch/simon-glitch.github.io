Speech: 1st Inaugural Address by President Barack Obama
Speech date: January 21, 2013

Barack Obama is the first black president, and he's only 50% black. Still, getting elected was hard for Obama, considering how racist many voters were. 13.6% [source 2] of Americans, and 13% of the U.S. Congress is black, so black people are finally represented correctly in the U.S. whitehouse.[source 1] Also, the U.S. cabinet has been quite diverse for a while. Despite their presidents being white, the cabinets of Clinton and Bush actually overrepresented blacks, but if you average the percentage of blacks across the last 7 presidential terms (not including the current presidential term), you get <!-- (27+20+19+13+6+25+6)/7 = --> a 16.6% proportion of blacks, which only slightly overrepresents black Americans. Biden's current cabinet is 19% black, which is arguably too much, since the Whitehouse should try to represent every American equally.[source 3]

Anyways, let's look at Obama's inaugural address. I think he is one of the **great** speakers of recent times, and his speech definitely deserves some analysis.

# Monroe's motivated sequence
## Introduction
Obama's introduction paragraph quotes the Declaration of Independence, which is actually genius. For some odd reason, that document is actually readable to most Americans, and has the best introduction statement of any document I've ever seen. Just seeing the first clause gets me excited.

Obama's introduction paragraph:
> Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution.  We affirm the promise of our democracy.  We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.  What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:
>> "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

Now, Obama could have made this way more engaging, by jusy saying the quote from the Declaration of Independence **first**. That quote is just too good to even delay putting in your speech.

Also, Obama's thesis is quite obvious. If you elect a black president, you expect him to make a big deal about black people are mistreated and how we need eqaulity, because we expect every black politician to feel that way. I know it sounds like I'm criticizing him, but I'm not. I think Obama's emphasis on ensuring equality for everyone is very important and justified. Also, Obama argues for total equality. He argues that we need gender equality, race equality, and equalizing support for the needy and the disabled. He argues that we should help to bring equality (or equity) to other nations to, through appropriate support programs. The only potential flaw with the way Obama emphasizes this is the fact that he openly admits that we can't achieve perfect equality. At least, not in this generation. I see this admittance as a flaw, because I think that we should be more optimistic, and that Obama should just try to push potential solutions. Even if we think we can't achieve something difficult, we should at least try and hope to find ways to make it easier or more achievable.

Despite his occasional pessimistic clarification, Obama finishes his introduction well, by noting that: "history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they’ve never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth".

Overall, Obama's intro was solid.

## Need
Presidential speeches tend to repeat their "needs" a lot, because there is not much for a president to say other than "here are the problems I am focused on helping to solve". Most presidents hardly stress the importance or relevance of voters. Even Obama, who said there is a "fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone", and therefore also said that the government is effectively powerless, still hardly ever mentioned the power of voters. As much as Obama makes his speech sound powerful, he also makes himself and Congress sound a bit powerless to do anything about the need. Obama is not unique in this regard: most presidential speeches imply that the need (i.e. the problems that country faces) are the only thing they can talk about, because the satisfaction of the need is almost impossible to achieve.

## Satisfaction
As I said, inaugural addresses tend to have very little satisfaction. State of the Union Addresses however, are actually specifically designed around satisfaction and visualization. Nonetheless, Obama does mention the accomplishments of U.S. government throughout history.

First, Obama re-emaphasize his thesis:
> Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free. We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.

In the intro, Obama says that "Together" we learned that our economy requires good infrastructure, a free market requires fair rules, and that a great nation must care for the weak. The use of the word together and the general repetition really helps to push this point forward and get the audience hyped to listen to him. The use of together here helps to restate his main thesis (that America needs to respect the rights of all people equally).

## Visualization
The visualizaiton part of Monroe's Motivated Sequence is absent from an inaugural address, and better suited for a State of the Union Address.

## Conclusion
Obama's conclusion is punctuated by his clarification of this thesis:
> That is our generation’s task -- to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American. Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life. It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.

# General nit-pitcking

Something I have noticed about most inaugural addresses and State of the Union Addresses (singular: SUA, plural: SUAs) is that tend to be overly wordy. However, even in their wordiness, there are some really inspiring individual paragraphs in them.
