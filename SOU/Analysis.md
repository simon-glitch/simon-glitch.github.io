Speech: 1st Inaugural Address by President Barack Obama
Speech date: January 21, 2013

Barack Obama is the first black president, and he's only 50% black. Still, getting elected was hard for Obama, considering how racist many voters were. 13.6% [source 2] of Americans, and 13% of the U.S. Congress is black, so black people are finally represented correctly in the U.S. whitehouse.[source 1] Also, the U.S. cabinet has been quite diverse for a while. Despite their presidents being white, the cabinets of Clinton and Bush actually overrepresented blacks, but if you average the percentage of blacks across the last 7 presidential terms (not including the current presidential term), you get <!-- (27+20+19+13+6+25+6)/7 = --> a 16.6% proportion of blacks, which only slightly overrepresents black Americans. Biden's current cabinet is 19% black, which is arguably too much, since the Whitehouse should try to represent every American equally.[source 3]

Anyways, let's look at Obama's inaugural address. I think he is one of the **great** speakers of recent times, and his speech definitely deserves some analysis.

# Monroe's motivated sequence
## Introduction
Obama's introduction paragraph quotes the Declaration of Independence, which is actually genius. For some odd reason, that document is actually readable to most Americans, and has the best introduction statement of any document I've ever seen. Just seeing the first clause gets me excited.

Obama's introduction paragraph:
> Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution.  We affirm the promise of our democracy.  We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.  What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:
>> "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

Now, Obama could have made this way more engaging, by jusy saying the quote from the Declaration of Independence **first**. That quote is just too good to even delay putting in your speech.

Obama finishes his introduction by noting that: "history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they’ve never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth".

Obama then says that "Together" we learned that our economy requires good infrastructure, a free market requires fair rules, and that a great nation must care for the weak. The use of the word together and the general repetition really helps to push this point forward and get the audience hyped to listen to him.

Overall, Obama's intro was solid.

## Need
Presidential speeches tend to repeat their "needs" a lot, because there is not much for a president to say other than "here are the problems I am focused on helping to solve". Most presidents hardly stress the importance or relevance of voters. Even Obama, who said there is a "fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone", and therefore also said that the government is effectively powerless, still hardly ever mentioned the power of voters. As much as Obama makes his speech sound powerful, he also makes himself and Congress sound a bit powerless to do anything about the need. Obama is not unique in this regard: most presidential speeches imply that the need (i.e. the problems that country faces) are the only thing they can talk about, because the satisfaction of the need is almost impossible to achieve.

# General nit-pitcking

Something I have noticed about most inaugural addresses and State of the Union Addresses (singular: SUA, plural: SUAs) is that tend to be overly wordy. However, even in their wordiness, there are some really inspiring individual paragraphs in them.
