Speech: 1st Inaugural Address by President Barack Obama
Speech date: January 21, 2013

Barack Obama is the first black president, and he's only 50% black. Still, getting elected was hard for Obama, considering how racist many voters were. 13.6% [source 2] of Americans, and 13% of the U.S. Congress is black, so black people are finally represented correctly in the U.S. whitehouse.[source 1] Also, the U.S. cabinet has been quite diverse for a while. Despite their presidents being white, the cabinets of Clinton and Bush actually overrepresented blacks, but if you average the percentage of blacks across the last 7 presidential terms (not including the current presidential term), you get <!-- (27+20+19+13+6+25+6)/7 = --> a 16.6% proportion of blacks, which only slightly overrepresents black Americans. Biden's current cabinet is 19% black, which is arguably too much, since the Whitehouse should try to represent every American equally.[source 3]

Anyways, let's look at Obama's inaugural address. I think he is one of the **great** speakers of recent times, and his speech definitely deserves some analysis.

# Monroe's motivated sequence


# General nit-pitcking

Something I have noticed about most inaugural addresses and State of the Union Addresses (singular: SUA, plural: SUAs) is that tend to be overly wordy. However, even in their wordiness, there are some really inspiring individual paragraphs in them.
