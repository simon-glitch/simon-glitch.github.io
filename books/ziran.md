No one would ever notice these small details, or even notice that he had gone to the woods, because Ziran was an infamous failure. Ziran knew that a piece of trash like him would never amount to anything. He hadn't even opened one chakra (meridian), even though all of his peers had opened all 7 of theirs. Ziran only had 1 use in his village: as a toy, for others to throw around during volleyball, a magic toy that would walk back to them every time they made a foul. He was a clown that people would paint and put on display. They would then go on to mock him and describe him as a counterexample to proper cultivation. Ziran in fact, was a bit of an oddity, in that no amount of herbs and medicines could make his chakras shine, as if he didn't have any. Of course, some doctors already knew of this disability, even though it was much rarer than other disabilities. Usually, someone like Ziran would've been fed to the dogs by now. Fortunately, his village had plenty of spare meat, thanks to the successful pig farm, and there were no dogs to be fed.

Anyways, Ziran walked through a messy path, deep in the woods, in an area of the woods that was well known for having almost no food, no herbs, and no monsters of any kind. Ziran had heard rumors of a new breed of nightshade that grew in these woods, but he didn't see anything of the like. These woods were lifeless and baren, save for the endless sea of maple trees, and the small weeds along the stone path.

The stone path, which Ziran is now sulking down, has been here for 20,000 years, and NOT aged well. It is filled with cracks and random roots of various trees. In fact, the path is so weathered that it can hardly even be recognized. If Ziran were to leave the path, even for a second, he would surely have a very hard time finding it again. With this in mind, Ziran tried to stay positive and chart carefully. He carefully looked down, making sure that none of the roots or cracks would trip him. As frail as he was, if he tripped, even falling 2 feet would probably break a limb. Considering the low traffic rate on this path, he would probably lie there helplessly and eventually die. Ziran didn't want that situation to occur, even though he did have mixed feelings about his desire to live.

Suddenly, while lost in his thoughts, Ziran heard a noise. He looked up to see if anyone was there, and saw what looked to be a humanoid hide behind a tree. As he continued walking forward, he watched the tree and didn't pay attention to the perilous path beneath his feet.

With this small error, he tripped on a root that was hidden in the shadow a tall tree. As he fell, and the despair hit him, Ziran quickly became ready to accept his fate.

"Whaaaa!" Ziran screamed.

However, the mysterious humanoid figure suddently emerged from the darkness of the woods. It was Peiyu, a kind-hearted stranger who miraculously managed to catch him before hitting the ground.

"I- I'm sorry." Peiyu exclaimed, gently setting him back on his feet.

Ziran looked up at her with utter confusion and shock. He was in awe as this was the first time someone cared enough to save him.

"Why'd you bother saving me?" Ziran asked, with a faced full of confusion and doubt.

"Why wouldn't I?" Peiyu replied, showing no sign of hesitation in her voice.
