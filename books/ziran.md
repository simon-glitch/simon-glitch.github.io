No one would ever notice these small details, or even notice that he had gone to the woods, because Ziran was an infamous failure. Ziran knew that a piece of trash like him would never amount to anything. He hadn't even opened one chakra (meridian), even though all of his peers had opened all 7 of theirs. Ziran only had 1 use in his village: as a toy, for others to throw around during volleyball, a magic toy that would walk back to them every time they made a foul. He was a clown that people would paint and put on display. They would then go on to mock him and describe him as a counterexample to proper cultivation. Ziran in fact, was a bit of an oddity, in that no amount of herbs and medicines could make his chakras shine, as if he didn't have any. Of course, some doctors already knew of this disability, even though it was much rarer than other disabilities. Usually, someone like Ziran would've been fed to the dogs by now. Fortunately, his village had plenty of spare meat, thanks to the successful pig farm, and there were no dogs to be fed.

Anyways, Ziran walked through a messy path, deep in the woods, in an area of the woods that was well known for having almost no food, no herbs, and no monsters of any kind. Ziran had heard rumors of a new breed of nightshade that grew in these woods, but he didn't see anything of the like. These woods were lifeless and baren, save for the endless sea of maple trees, and the small weeds along the stone path.

The stone path, which Ziran is now sulking down, has been here for 20,000 years, and NOT aged well. It is filled with cracks and random roots of various trees. In fact, the path is so weathered that it can hardly even be recognized. If Ziran were to leave the path, even for a second, he would surely have a very hard time finding it again. With this in mind, Ziran tried to stay positive and chart carefully. He carefully looked down, making sure that none of the roots or cracks would trip him. As frail as he was, if he tripped, even falling 2 feet would probably break a limb. Considering the low traffic rate on this path, he would probably lie there helplessly and eventually die. Ziran didn't want that situation to occur, even though he did have mixed feelings about his desire to live.

Suddenly, while lost in his thoughts, Ziran heard a noise. He looked up to see if anyone was there, and saw what looked to be a humanoid hide behind a tree. As he continued walking forward, he watched the tree and didn't pay attention to the perilous path beneath his feet.

With this small error, he tripped on a root that was hidden in the shadow a tall tree. As he fell, and the despair hit him, Ziran quickly became ready to accept his fate.

"Whaaaa!" Ziran screamed.

However, the mysterious humanoid figure suddently emerged from the darkness of the woods. It was Peiyu, a kind-hearted stranger who miraculously managed to catch him before hitting the ground.

"Be careful." Peiyu exclaimed, holding the arms of his unsteady body.

Ziran looked up at her with utter confusion and shock. He was in awe. This was the first time, **ever**, that someone cared enough to save him.

"Why'd you bother saving *my* life?" Ziran asked, as shock, confusion and doubt filled his mind. Ziran's face only showed one thing: sorrow. His eyes filled with tears, and he thought about all of the times people intentionally made him suffer.

"Why wouldn't I?" Peiyu replied, showing no sign of hesitation in her voice as she embraced him.

As Ziran cried, he realized how weak he was, and became afraid. *This girl could kill me at any moment; she could suck the life qi out of my bones in an instant, and gain cultivation. I hope she doesn't have any evil plans or ulterior motives.* Ziran thought to himself.

Ziran's arms were trembling, and although Peiyu couldn't read his mind, she knew that he was not emoitonally OK. Her heart was filled with concern, as her empathetic nature took control. She didn't understand why this boy was so weak and helpless, but she wanted to help him. She wanted to help him become strong, so he wouldn't have to cry like this so much. As Peiyu lifted his face, and examined it more clearly, she saw many things. She was stains on his cheeks, which were clearly caused by excessive cyring. *This guy probably has the world record for the most time spent crying.* She thought to herself. This thought lit a fire within her soul. A fire that would not quit, could not stop, and could not be put out. It was at this moment, that Peiyu realized that she has a won't-stop / can't-stop mentality.

"It's OK, rice ball~" Peiyu hummed. "I, Peiyu will make you strong enough to move the occean with those tears."

"That --" Ziran tried to speak, but couldn't. He was going to tell her *That will never happen*, but his frail body couldn't maintain his consciousness any more. He should've brough a canteen of water on this trip, so he would have had the hydration for this. Luckily for Ziran, Peiyu was a seasoned expert at surviving in the woods, and could tell that he was a bit dehydrated. She couldn't carry his body, so she gently laid him down on the path. She made sure to align him in the center of the path, that way he wouldn't roll off into a ditch if he tossed or turned in his sleep.

"I will be right back." Peiyu hummed, even though she was pretty sure that he couldn't hear her.

As Peiyu went to collect water, she had a deep conversation with herself in her head. *I can't believe there is actually a **man** who is weaker than me. I hope he survives. It would be so nice to have peer who doesn't look down on me. I hope he doesn't have an ulterior motives. I can't imagine that he does though. With how weak he is, he's probably even more humble than I am. With that kind of humility, I can't imagine someone having almost any ulteiror motive or bad intention whatsoever. I could be wrong, but I probably don't have to worry about it. In fact, considering just how weak he is, I think I can trust him. I will want to wait though, and collect more evidence of this hypothesis. For now, I can safely assume that he is trustworthy, at least, as far as moral principles are concerned. I can trust that he won't hurt me, but I can't trust him to perform a simple task, especially physical labor, just because he is so weak.*

Peiyu got to the stream, and collected 8 canteens of water. Peiyu used a rope, with knots designed to hold the canteens, and filled all 8 containers at once. She then collected them, and put them in a bag. Peiyu drank 3 canteens, and then filled them again. *Carrying these 10 pounds of water is difficult, but I can do it.* She carried the water back to her secret fort, deep in the woods. She put 5 down, and took 3 with her on her way back to Ziran.

*Wow, I really do pity this poor boy. I sure am glad that I am not as weak as him. I am still pathetically weak, but at least I have opened 1 of my chakras. For the past 10 years, I have struggled with cultivating, because I got a childhood disease that stagnated my cultivation. This disease prevented me from cultivaring. Luckily, my father hired a physician who found a cure to the disease. After 10 years of not being able to cultivate, I finally had a chance. Now, I can at least look forward to being able to work as a peasant in the future. This boy though, he probably won't be so fortunate.* Peiyu thought this as she walked back to Peiyu, and sat down next to him. I really hope
