No one would ever notice these small details, or even notice that he had gone to the woods, because Ziran was an infamous failure. Ziran knew that a piece of trash like him would never amount to anything. He hadn't even opened one chakra (meridian), even though all of his peers had opened all 7 of theirs. Ziran only had 1 use in his village: as a toy, for others to throw around during volleyball, a magic toy that would walk back to them every time they made a foul. He was a clown that people would paint and put on display. They would then go on to mock him and describe him as a counterexample to proper cultivation. Ziran in fact, was a bit of an oddity, in that no amount of herbs and medicines could make his chakras shine, as if he didn't have any. Of course, some doctors already knew of this disability, even though it was much rarer than other disabilities. Usually, someone like Ziran would've been fed to the dogs by now. Fortunately, his village had plenty of spare meat, thanks to the successful pig farm, and there were no dogs to be fed.

Anyways, Ziran walked through a messy path, deep in the woods, in an area of the woods that was well known for having almost no food, no herbs, and no monsters of any kind. Ziran had heard rumors of a new breed of nightshade that grew in these woods, but he didn't see anything of the like. These woods were lifeless and baren, save for the endless sea of maple trees, and the small weeds along the stone path.

The stone path, which Ziran is now sulking down, has been here for 20,000 years, and NOT aged well. It is filled with cracks and random roots of various trees. In fact, the path is so weathered that it can hardly even be recognized. If Ziran were to leave the path, even for a second, he would surely have a very hard time finding it again. With this in mind, Ziran tried to stay positive and chart carefully. He carefully looked down, making sure that none of the roots or cracks would trip him. As frail as he was, if he tripped, even falling 2 feet would probably break a limb. Considering the low traffic rate on this path, he would probably lie there helplessly and eventually die. Ziran didn't want that situation to occur, even though he did have mixed feelings about his desire to live.

Suddenly, while lost in his thoughts, Ziran heard a noise. He looked up to see if anyone was there, and saw what looked to be a humanoid hide behind a tree. As he continued walking forward, he watched the tree and didn't pay attention to the perilous path beneath his feet.

With this small error, he tripped on a root that was hidden in the shadow a tall tree. As he fell, and the despair hit him, Ziran quickly became ready to accept his fate.

"Whaaaa!" Ziran screamed.

However, the mysterious humanoid figure suddently emerged from the darkness of the woods. It was Peiyu, a kind-hearted stranger who miraculously managed to catch him before hitting the ground.

"Be careful." Peiyu exclaimed, holding the arms of his unsteady body.

Ziran looked up at her with utter confusion and shock. He was in awe. This was the first time, **ever**, that someone cared enough to save him.

"Why'd you bother saving *my* life?" Ziran asked, as shock, confusion and doubt filled his mind. Ziran's face only showed one thing: sorrow. His eyes filled with tears, and he thought about all of the times people intentionally made him suffer.

"Why wouldn't I?" Peiyu replied, showing no sign of hesitation in her voice as she embraced him.

As Ziran cried, he realized how weak he was, and became afraid. *This girl could kill me at any moment; she could suck the life qi out of my bones in an instant, and gain cultivation. I hope she doesn't have any evil plans or ulterior motives.* Ziran thought to himself.

Ziran's arms were trembling, and although Peiyu couldn't read his mind, she knew that he was not emoitonally OK. Her heart was filled with concern, as her empathetic nature took control. She didn't understand why this boy was so weak and helpless, but she wanted to help him. She wanted to help him become strong, so he wouldn't have to cry like this so much. As Peiyu lifted his face, and examined it more clearly, she saw many things. She was stains on his cheeks, which were clearly caused by excessive cyring. *This guy probably has the world record for the most time spent crying.* She thought to herself. This thought lit a fire within her soul. A fire that would not quit, could not stop, and could not be put out. It was at this moment, that Peiyu realized that she has a won't-stop / can't-stop mentality.

"It's OK, rice ball~" Peiyu hummed. "I, Peiyu will make you strong enough to move the occean with those tears."

"That --" Ziran tried to speak, but couldn't. He was going to tell her *That will never happen*, but his frail body couldn't maintain his consciousness any more. He should've brough a canteen of water on this trip, so he would have had the hydration for this. Luckily for Ziran, Peiyu was a seasoned expert at surviving in the woods, and could tell that he was a bit dehydrated. She couldn't carry his body, so she gently laid him down on the path. She made sure to align him in the center of the path, that way he wouldn't roll off into a ditch if he tossed or turned in his sleep.

"I will be right back." Peiyu hummed, even though she was pretty sure that he couldn't hear her.

As Peiyu went to collect water, she had a deep conversation with herself in her head. *I can't believe there is actually a **man** who is weaker than me. I hope he survives. It would be so nice to have peer who doesn't look down on me. I hope he doesn't have an ulterior motives. I can't imagine that he does though. With how weak he is, he's probably even more humble than I am. With that kind of humility, I can't imagine someone having almost any ulteiror motive or bad intention whatsoever. I could be wrong, but I probably don't have to worry about it. In fact, considering just how weak he is, I think I can trust him. I will want to wait though, and collect more evidence of this hypothesis. For now, I can safely assume that he is trustworthy, at least, as far as moral principles are concerned. I can trust that he won't hurt me, but I can't trust him to perform a simple task, especially physical labor, just because he is so weak.*

Peiyu got to the stream, and collected 8 canteens of water. Peiyu used a rope, with knots designed to hold the canteens, and filled all 8 containers at once. She then collected them, and put them in a bag. Peiyu drank 3 canteens, and then filled them again. *Carrying these 10 pounds of water is difficult, but I can do it.* She carried the water back to her secret fort, deep in the woods. She put 5 down, and took 3 with her on her way back to Ziran.

*Wow, I really do pity this poor boy. I sure am glad that I am not as weak as him. I am still pathetically weak, but at least I have opened 1 of my chakras. For the past 10 years, I have struggled with cultivating, because I got a childhood disease that stagnated my cultivation. This disease prevented me from cultivaring. Luckily, my father hired a physician who found a cure to the disease. After 10 years of not being able to cultivate, I finally had a chance. Now, I can at least look forward to being able to work as a peasant in the future. This boy though, he probably won't be so fortunate.* Peiyu thought this as she walked back to Peiyu, and sat down next to him.

"I really hope you can get stonger. I also hope you can drink this water ... Hihi!" Peiyu giggled with a face full of delight. "Alright..." she got on her knees and sat behind Ziran. Then, she picked up his head, and crawled under his back, until she leaned his 
head and torso back against her chest. Then she grabbed a canteen of water, and poured a little down Ziran's throat, hoping he would swallow it instintively.

*Gulp* - Ziran **did** swallow the water instively. Peiyu continued feeding the water to him, using one hand to hold his head in place, and another hand to pour the water. She gave him an entire canteen of water, and then waited a few minutes. "I will wait for your stomach to heat back up. I know drinking too fast can cause the stomach to throw up from the temperature change~" Peiyu wispered.

After a few minutes, she fed him another canteen, waited again, and fed him again. When she was all done she grabbed her lunch that she had packed. Peiyu wispered "You seem well nourished enough, so I won't bother feeding you any food."

Paiyu pulled back, and layed Ziran's head back down, that way she could have her chest free. Peiyu then sat there eating her food, while Ziran slept peacefully.

Eventually, Ziran woke up. As he woke up, Paiyu was working on refining a simple herb. Ziran put his mind to work. He realized that he had been dehydrated, and had fainted from exhaustion. Furthermore, he saw Paiyu's empty canteens on the ground and concluded that she must have given him water. He didn't immediately understand how, but after another moment he realized that she must have manually fed him the water. This thought bewildered him, and his mind stirred like a hurricane, questioning this idea and its audacity. *How could she be THAT kind though?! No one would ever go out of their way to ensure MY well being! Especially not a fair young lady like this. She had better things to do then to care for me. Hmm ... she seems like the kind of person who would do that. She almost feels like ... she is meant to be my mother. Well, I'm not really sure about that. I guess I'll just have to be her friend and try to return this kindness when I get the chance. With that in mind, I should thank her, shouldn't I?*

"Um... miss, thank you. For saving me, I thank you with all my heart. Even though I don't feel like my life is important, you made me feel important. Thanks for the water, and thank you for being here. Thank you for watching me and making sure I don't get eaten by a wild boar." Ziran said, with his voice wavering, as he was having a hard time being sincere and expressing his gratitude seriously. He just didn't feel comfortable with the idea of someone else valuing his life.

Peiyu could tell that Ziran had a hard time expressing himself. She knew that her kindness had touched him in a way he wasn't comfortable with. This boy needs more care then I thought. I wonder if it's his pride that's getting in the way? I wonder if he doesn't want to owe me anything? Is he scared of disappointing me in the future? Or does he just want to be with someone else?

"You're welcome," Peiyu replied, and offered Ziran a warm smile. "But my name is Peiyu, by the way."

"Ah, and my name is Ziran."

Peiyu gave Ziran a smile and a gentle pat on the head, then said, "Now that you're feeling a bit better, what do you plan on doing next?"


Simanelix
"Why would YOU care? Shouldn't we focus on your plans and desires?" Ziran asked.

Peiyu gave Ziran an odd look, like she found his question quite perplexing.

"Why shouldn't I care? I have nothing to hide." Peiyu replied. "You also seem to need some guidance, especially now that you know how weak you are. So, I think it would be helpful for me to know what you plan on doing moving forward, so I can give you some helpful advice."

Simanelix
"Well, I don't have any plans. I guess, I would like to open my chakras? Haha! Like that is ever going to happen." Ziran laughed at himself.

Peiyu felt pity, and decided to stay optimistic. "Well, why can't you open your chakras?"

"Well, ... I have shadow chakras. Shadow chakras can't be opened and prevent me from cultivating qi" he replied with a gloomy face.

"Ah. I actually know the solution to your problem~" she chimed with a huge smile and a long blink.

Peiyu's smile caught Ziran by surprise and gave him some hope.

"Oh?" Ziran responded. "What solution can you provide?"

Peiyu's words piqued Ziran's curiosity and made him eager to learn more about Peiyu's plan to overcome his shadow chakras.


Simanelix
Peiyu's eyes shined with excitement. She spoke in a very feminine voice: "Shadow chakras can't be opened by any amount of qi. Instead, they must be opened with shaded-energy from the shaded-realm. I read about it in an ancient book, and shaded-energy can manipulate light and water in all kinds of interesting ways. Usually, children with shadow chakras are killed when they are young, because most people are taught the myth that any one with chakras that don't glow can't cultivate. The myth is false, and thus most people never even learn about shadow chakras, and they are a misunderstood health condition. If you want, I can make you a copy of the book about the shaded-realm that I read. Unfortunately I don't have the book on me right now. I left it in my family's library. So, um, would you like me to tell you everything that I can recall from the book, for now?"

Peiyu's excitement and enthusiasm was contagious, and Ziran felt himself growing more optimistic with each word that Peiyu spoke. The notion of learning more about the shaded-realm and the possibility of opening his chakras was very intriguing to him.

"Of course," Ziran replied with a determined expression. "Please tell me everything you can recall right now. I want to learn as much as I can."

Peiyu's warm and inviting presence provided Ziran with a feeling of comfort and safety, and he felt confident that she would guide him in the right direction.


Simanelix
"And you want a copy of the book, too, right?" Peiyu asked.

Peiyu's offer of a copy of the book caught Ziran by surprise. He had already been interested in learning more about the shaded-realm, and the idea of having a book that contained more information was very tempting.

"Yes, please," Ziran replied with a confident smile. "Having a copy of the book will be very valuable to me, and I would love to reread it over and over again to learn more about the shaded-realm and shadow chakras."


Simanelix
Peiyu replied, "Well, the book seems to be highly theoretical. I don't think the author could actually see or interact with the shaded-realm porperly. The author didn't have shadow chakras himself. And he couldn't find friends with shadow chakras either, since even back in his time, children with shadow chakras were often killed at a young age, and shadow chakras are rare to begin with. According to the author, only 1 in 100,000 persons born has shadow chakras. Plus, people with shadow chakras are naturally weak, due to the effects of the shaded-realm."

"Anyways, a lot of the book is just speculations. It should still be very useful to you though, since you actually have shadow chakras, and the book is based on the author's real observations that he was able to make. Also, the book is really long: 700 pages long. This is a good thing, since you will be able to learn a lot of ideas from it, and then refine those ideas into truth through your own experimentation. Doesn't that sound thrilling, Ziran?"

"Definitely. I'm eager to read the book and learn more about the shaded-realm," Ziran replied. "Even if some of the author's speculation turns out to be inaccurate, there will still be a lot of valuable information that I can use to help me open my shadow chakras."

Peiyu's words made Ziran realize something: he could learn much more about the shaded-realm from reading the book than Peiyu could tell him, since she did not have any experience with shadow chakras herself.

"Thank you," Ziran nodded. "I look forward to reading the book."


"I look forward to seeing you get stronger." Peiyu cheered, "I am so glad that you are finally becoming optimistic. I understand how it feels when the whole world is against you, since I used to be in a similar position. Of course, I don't have shadow chakras like you do."

"Hmm..." Peiyu pondered for a second, "How much can you life anyways? You arms look like noodles to begin with. I'm guessing you have tried to at least build muscle ... does your family feed you at least?" Worry started to fill Peiyu's conscious. She could easily presume that Ziran's family doesn't feed him, since he is so pathetically weak.

Peiyu's concern and empathy surprised Ziran, and he felt his heart flutter a little.

*I haven't had a family member who cared about my well-being for a long time.* Ziran thought.

"My parents aren't very generous with food, so I don't eat a lot," Ziran confessed. "My hunger usually gets so bad that I sometimes steal vegetables from our garden."

Peiyu's worries grew even more and she felt very sad for Ziran. Peiyu also felt angry towards Ziran's parents for not properly providing for their son.

"Ah, and I can only life 15 lbs. And I can carry approximately 15 lbs in a backpack." Ziran answered her question.

"Well, that all changes today, Ziran." Peiyu put her hand on his shoulder, and looked into his eyes with determination. Ziran could see an actual fire light in her iris. This was a magical display of emotion, which proved that Peiyu had at least opened her 1st chakra. Ziran felt a little jealous, because he couldn't do that.

*Yet. I can't do that yet, but I might be able to in the future.* Ziran's heart was filled with the hope and fire he could feel emnating from Peiyu. It was like a fraction of her energy and charisma had somehow been transfered into him.

Peiyu saw Ziran smiling, and knew *I am succeeding.* With this, she said "I will make you a man, and you will grow strong enough to lift the entire continent!" This was a bit of a hyperbole, since the strongest person in known history could only lift 5% of the continent.

Ziran's heart began to race as Peiyu's determination radiated an intensity that Ziran had never felt before. In that moment, Peiyu's words and actions made Ziran feel like he was strong and capable of anything, even though Peiyu was aware that it was just a little hyperbole.

Ziran felt his hunger leave him as Peiyu's charisma and energy filled his body. He felt like he could take on the world and accomplish his goals, thanks to Peiyu's words and motivation.

*I will become strong. I will open my shadow chakras.* Ziran told himself with determination.

"Good. Now that you are hyped, you can begin learning about the shaded-realm." Peiyu said, now calmed down.

Peiyu sat down, and began orating a great lecture. "A long time ago, the world's light was too powerful, and prevented life form evolving into multicellular organisms. So, the lord of shadows created the shaded-realm. He used the shaded-realm to add powerful shading to the world, and allow for matter to take on more complex forms. With this, the wide of variety of life we know today was able to evolve. The shaded-realm powerful wormholes to link the shaded-realm to the main-realm. The main-realm is the space that WE live in. These wormholes are all over the place, and are able to persist regardless of the chaotic forces of nature around them. Wormholes allow shade-worms to travel between the 2 realms. Shade-worms correct extremely high levels of energy, forcing it to dissipate and stabilize. Shade-worms are actually attracted to dancing shadows and flickering lights. There is also another kind of worm, called memory worms. These prevent hallucinations and prevent dreams from harming the soul. You can summon memory worms by intentionally imagining complex stories in your head. If there are both shade-worms and memory worms in the same small vicinity, they can create memory vortexes. These are regions of warped space that, when focused on, reinforces wormholes to the shaded-realm. More importantly, if an onlooker focuses on the warped space, it should summon shadow-bunnies, and generate a small amount of shade-energy."

Peiyu's words were like music to Ziran's ears. Each sentence contained a wealth of information that Ziran eagerly soaked up like a sponge. Ziran listened closely to every word Peiyu said, taking mental notes as he took in the knowledge she was imparting.

"That's a lot of information," Ziran noted as he made a mental note of what Peiyu had explained so far. "But it's very interesting. And you said that shade-worms can help me open my shadow chakras?"

Peiyu nodded and replied to Ziran's question.

"Yes. Shade-worms are the key to opening shadow chakras in the main world." Peiyu told Ziran. "In the past, people who had shadow chakras found a way to lure shade-worms into the main realm to open their shadow chakras and cultivate qi."

Peiyu's explanation further filled Ziran with hope and excitement. Peiyu's words inspired him and made him want to learn more.
