Title: Elecharia
* Male-oriented
    * Might work as a Female-oriented story, but I have no clue what males or females prefer.
    * Also, I do plan on adding in LGBTQ support, to make the story more lively and relatable.
* Genre: Fantasy

Synopsis:
* A fantasy story about finding freedom in the face of oppression. The main characters face many challenges and fight for their lives together. The story has lots of worldbuilding around its magic system too. There will also be tiny bit of romance, but this story focuses on the theme of finding freedom. The story can also be found at simon-glitch.github.io / books / elecharia. Also, most of the narration is done from a female perspective, but that's just to make the male lead more mysterious.

Additional notes:
* I will never publish this story.

Copyright:
* This story is my original work, but I'm fine with other people freely sharing it. Therefore, I'm placing it in the public domain. If this violates the ToS of Inkstone or WebNovel, I don't really care. My original intentions are what matters the most, to me personally.
