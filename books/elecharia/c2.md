# Chapter 2
Narrator: Boron

Ah, I remember that day so warmly. It was the day me and Rosa first met. Well, I have had more exciting and interesting days since then, but it was definitely a notable day in my life.

I had just become an adult, so the sweatshop I worked at kicked me out. The sweatshop was a mixed living unit, where beast people like me could work until we became adults, at the still very young age of 10 years old. Rosa wasn't much older than me, and I could see that.

"What a strange girl." I thought at first. After watching her pick the sublow quality herbs, I started to think "She seems a lot like me. She must not have much to talk about.". But her sentences were so short. That's when I realized that she was unintelligent. I didn't really mind, since I wasn't intelligent myself.

Now, she was leading me through the forest, not really knowing her way around, and I could tell that she didn't know much better than me. However, more than anything else, I was grateful for her help, and felt a lot of admiration towards her. She was great at picking herbs, and I felt kind of comfortable knowing that she wasn't any smarter than me.

Why did Rosa even ask me to narrate this? I'm not going to say anything different than her. Oh, I get it. She wants me to share the thoughts I had at the time. I don't think who is narrating matters that much, but whatever. Enjoy the read.

We got to the same ditch we came across entering the forest. Now, this ditch does not cross the entire forest, and I had assumed that to be the case, so I felt a little impressed that she found it. I even let out a little "huh" of impressedness.
