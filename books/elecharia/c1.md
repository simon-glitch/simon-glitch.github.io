# Chapter 1
Narrator: Rosa

I remember that day so warmly. Well, it used to be kinda hard to remember, because I didn't really remember anything from that time, but I'm currently using a spell that lets me relive my old experiences, even if I don't remember them. Ah, doesn't that sound just absolutely wonderful? I can assure you, it really is. I bet you'd love to do that yourself and tell me all about the most wonderful times in your life. Anyways, um, I may as well narrate this for you.

@ Boron: Hey, what's going on here?

Oh, I'm ... recording all of the lovely details of my life, and our adventure.

@ Boron: Well, that sounds great.

Ooh! You should narrate the next chapter!

@ Boron: Chapter??

Yeah. I'm formatting it in a book for someone.

@ Boron: You sure do have some weird projects.

Hey! Don't act like you're the normal one here!

@ Boron: Okay, okay. I'll help narrate some of it for you.

Good boy. I new you'd understand. :D

Now, um... oh, right. I should be narrating.

### Alright, let's narrate this

The first time I met Boron, it wasn't magical, but it was very important. My mother had just died the day before. She was out shopping, and one of the racist people in town saw her and was really disgusted, because she was a troll. Us high trolls have always been seen as inferior beings with less intelligence than others, even though we're not really unintelligent at all. People just hate us because they are racist. Luckily, the man who killed my mother didn't know much about her and was not an immediate threat to me, as long as I didn't happen to randomly runinto him. The day my mother died, I cried myself to sleep, and felt horrible. Luckily, after waking up, I got super motivated to move on and get stronger, so I wouldn't like my mama did. So, I went to the neighboring town, and went to the adventurer's guild. That's where I met my very first friend.

I walked in, and it wasn't super busy. The 2 adventuers that were sitting at a table talking about their next quest went silent and glared at me, noticing that I am a troll.

"Oh, hi there." The receptionist said pretty plainly.

I was going to respond, but then the entrance door suddenly opened. The adventurers jerked their heads in that direction, and glared at the boy that just walked in, which was Boron. After a mere second, the adventurers realized that me and Boron weren't really that important, and decided to continue talking about their quests. The receptionist dropped her shoulders a little and let out a sigh.

She looked directly at me. "Now, girl, what are you here for?"

"Me become adventurer, request."

"Huh?"

"Me become adventurer. Apply."

The receptionist did not like how simple my speech was. You see, I really wasn't very educated or good at speaking back in the day, so I was very hard to understand.

The receptionist frowned. "Okay. That will cost 10 silver."

I put 10 silver on the table. I was kind of stressed, but that's because I was not used to interacting with people.

The receptionist calmly placed an adventurer card on the table. I grabbed one of the scalpels, and pricked my finger to drop a drop of blood on it.

The boy behind me interrupted us while I was doing that. "I'd like to apply too."

The receptionist quickly pulled out another card, and held it in the air. "Silver, please."

He quickly payed, as if this was a race between him and the receptionist. They were both smiling now. How cute. I just watched them mindlessly (I still thought they were cute though). My adventurer card is now complete, and has my name and stats on it.

**[ SORRY ]**

The boy quickly drops a drop his blood on the card, using the scalpel I just used, instead of one of the other 20 of them, not that is matters. He then puts it in the empty jar labeled "dirty".

The receptionist puts the silver coins away, and looks at both cards, flipping them around.

"Wow, you two are bound for success. You should make a party."

The other 2 adventurers in the room stop talking for a moment and look our way. Then they go back to talking. They are now walking about another adventurer they've partied with before.

I look at the boy blankly, and then back at the receptionist. The boy looks at his card, and grimaces. He must have noticed how bad his stats are. All of his stats are 0, and he's level 1. He looks at mine, and notices the same thing. I remember why I'm here, and put my card in my pocket.

The boy thinks for a moment. He's pondering whether forming a party is a good idea.

"Good idea." He looks at my face, which was pointed at a painting on the wall.

"Um." He taps my shoulder, and I get a bit startled. I take a step back and look back at him.

"Do you want to join my party?"

"Ohhh wuhhh. Confirm." I have a hard time looking for the word, but agree.

He is a bit confusd though. "Huh?" He tilts his head. I nod slightly.

"Is she your sister or something?" The receptionist ask. The boy looks at her a bit sheepishly and a bit surprised.

I had not given her the best impression, and it would make perfect sense for him to bring his sister with him, or accompany his sister, is she was as awkward as I as.

"N-n-n-no." The boy sheepishly stuttered.

The receptionist sighed. She pulled out some papers and markers, and started making flyers for a public event.

The boy looked at me. "Will you join my party?" He asked harshly.

I sighed, relieving some stress, and gave him a confused look. I had assumed that he must have wanted something else (or course, I would have had no idea what, but I still felt like there was something else). After my sigh, I concluded that he was just asking me to join his party.

"Confirm. Positive."

The boy tilted his head in confusion. Unfortunately for him, I did not know the words "yes" or "no". The only words I knew were ones related to magic and spells. I was like that nerdy kid who is so awkward because he's not even used to using your vocabulary. Actually, nevermind that. I don't think the average nerd is as lacking in their vocab as I was in mine.

"Um, okay?" The boy sighed. Then he looked at the quest board and walked over. I stood in-place for a second, and then walked over to the board.

He looked at me, and I looked back. He thought for a second, and realized that I did want to be in his party. He then found an E rank quest to pick 300 magic herbs. He brought it over to the receptionist. "I'd like to accept this quest."

"Alright." The receptionist put it under her desk and continued working on her flyers.

The boy came over to me. "Come on." He gestured for me to follow him, so I did.

We walked out of town, and towards the nearby woods.

"So, who are you?" He asked.

I looked at him blankly, not understanding his question.

"Ugh. What is your name?" He asked after another moment.

"Name..." I thought for a moment. I recognized that word.

"Rosa." I recalled. My mother has used my name many times, but I've almost forgotten what the word "name" means.

"Hi Rosa. I'm Boron."

Unfortunately, I did not understand that, and just glanced at him.

"You're not very talkative, are you?" He asked with a frown.

I gave him a confused look. He sighed and shook his head.

We continued our walk into the forest.

The forest was dense, and the boy almost immediately tripped. I ran over to him, and grabbed his hand. He was a bit surprised by that, and tried to force my hand off him.

"Stabilize." I said. He gave me a bewildered look, and sighed. He stopped struggling, and I led him through the woods, making sure he didn't trip.

I let go of his hands when we got to large ditch with a bunch of roots that we could use to cross it. I turned around and watched him climb on the roots behind me. I helped stabilize him twice when he almost fell over.

"Thanks." He smiled after we finished crossing.

We walked a little further, and found one of the meadows where the medicinal herbs grow.

"Good, we're here. Now you pick 150 of them, and I'll pick the other 150, okay?"

I give him a blank look. He sighs and outs his hand on his forhead while wincing.

He walks over to one of the plants, and plucks the auxiliary leaves off of it.

"These." He puts the leaves in my hands.

"Low quality." I say plainly.

"It's low quality. Wait, how do you know that?"

I look at them again, and bring them to by nose, sniffing them.

"Low quality. Confirm."

"Okay then... I guess you can just tell. Pick more, okay?"

He starts picking the herbs, and I move closer and watch him for a moment. I see what he's doing, and notice he's not holding the stem correctly when the plucks the leaves off. I also notice that this plant doesn't even require you to pluck at it.

"Inefficient. Watch." I stop him, and show him how to a slide his fingers along the plant and kinda slice the leaves off that way. It's much faster and easier.

I grab his hand and take him to the next one.

"Sublow quality. Bend." I use a knuckle to bend part of the plant, and slide the leaves off the bend. The sublow quality plants are stiff like that, so you need to bend them to overcome it.

"Wow. You know what you're doing, don't you?" He looks at me in awe.

I hnnd him the leaves, and search through the field, crawling on my knees. I figure wit their being so many herbs here, there are probably some medium or subhigh quality ones.

I search and search, and find a large bundle of multiple dozen medium quality ones. I smile.

"Medium quality. Pinch. Turn." I tighlty pinch a part of the plant where a bunch of leaves branch off, and twist the leaves while also twisting the rest of the plant. The leaves easily pop off. I hand them to Boron, and quickly repeat the process 3 more times for other 3 bundles of large leaves on the plant. I ignore the smaller fresher leaves, because on these herbs, the small leaves are not useful when picked, and are better left to mature, like unripe fruits.

Boron continues collecting everything. "Wow. You're so fast. You must be quite experienced."

"Fast." I say, recognizing the word.

"How come you don't talk much though?"

I don't respond, because I have no idea what his question meant, and continue picking herbs. I find some subhigh quality herbs. "Turn, turn, turn." I twist the herbs 3 times back and forth to harvest their leaves.

"No one around here really likes beast people, so I was hoping I could become an adventurer." He says with worry in his tone.

"Beast people." I look at him, and see that he is a lizard beast person.

"Yeah. What are you?"

I look at him, and show him another plant. "Fire herb." I harvest it the same way the other herbs are harvested.

I grab some bark, and take a leaf, and grind down part of it with my knuckle, and then break off a piece of one of the low quality herbs, and put it in my mouth with some seeds off the grass. I chew it up into a mulch, and whistle through it while looking up. A small streak of fire comes out of my mouth as I do.

"Wowww!!! That's so cool!" Boron is amazed by my alchemical trick.

It keeps blowing for about 30 seconds. Then I pull it out of my mouth, and rip of the mixture throwing a bit of it around here and there.

"I tried asking what species you are though."

"Species. Turnina, cordid, barobble, tiffoa, maple, trynaut, ebcoli..." I name a bunch of species of herbs and plants with useful magical properties.

"What? No. I mean you." He taps me.

"This. What race are you?"

I give him a blank look, and grab the finger he poked me with. He tries pulling his finger out, and I hold it tighter.

He sighs, and I let go of his finger.

"You're really weird, you know that?"

I frown, becuase he seems to be unhappy with me.

He frowns back, but he looks sad, because he cares about how I feel.

He calms down, says "Pick more herbs.", and waves one of the leaves in my face.

"Low quality." I say while looking at the herb.

We look at each other for a brief second, and I decide to continue picking herbs. I turn around, stand up, and walk to the other side of the meadow.

I find a cluster of boulders, and avoid it.

After checking around the meadow, I go back near the boulders, and scan them thoroughly. I'm checking to see if any dangerous insects or snakes might be living around them. After checking, I find no dangers, and proceed to check for any good herbs. I manage to find a nice bunch of herbs growing near a shorter boulder, surrounded by thick grass and wild flowers.

I crouch down, and move some grass out of the way to make the herbs more visible. I look at Boron.

"High quality."

"You found high quality ones? I heard those are so rare!"

"Large rock." I point at the cluster of boulders.

"That's how you knew. Smart." Boron replies.

I get up and walk over to the forest.

"What are you doing?"

"Small rock." I tell him that I'm looking for a small rock.

"What are you going to do with it?"

"High quality banuin." I state the name of the herbs I found a short moment ago.

"Oh really?" Boron seems to understand.

I search through the woods, and find a small stone that fits in one hand and has an edge with an angle of 160 degrees. I walk back over to the herbs, and sit down.

I press the stone against part of the stem where the leaves branch off, and pull the plant back on the stone, holding it down with my right thumb. Then I use my left hand to twist the leaves, slowly, and move the leaves from my left hand to my right, pressing them between the stone and the stem. Then I hold the stem with my left hand, and slice the leaves off with my right hand. Finally, I hand the leaves to Boron, who is sitting next to me, watching. He started sitting next to me after I harvested herbs for about an hour. Now he's sitting even closer than last time. I scooch over for more room, because he is kind of in the way.

That took a minute. I repeat the process twice more for this plant, and then move on to the next plant.

The last set of leaves is pretty high up, so I will do them later. I crawl over to the 5 other plants, and glare at Boron every time he sits too close to me. He seems to figure out by the last plant that I need a foot of working room. However, him sitting close does mean I don't have to reach as far to hand him the leaves. However, he just takes the leaves from me after the 1st plant, since he can tell when I'm done.

I stand up, and start working on the top leaves of all of the plants. These plants have grown very tall, probably because no one has harvested from them in a long time. I heavest 2 to 3 sets of leaves from the tops of every plant.

"I think we have enough herbs now." Boron's 3 bags are really packed.

I grab one of the bags, and put it on my back.

"Huh. Thanks a lot, Rosa." He smiles.

I smile back at him.

He starts walking in a random direction, and I follow him. I follow closely, and make sure he doesn't trip on the dozens roots, rocks, and holes in the ground that make him stumble.

After some time, he stops. "Um, this doesn't seem to be the way back to town. Do you know the way?"

"Path to town?" I ask.

"Yes. The path to town." Boron says.

I look at him for a minute, and see the pleading look in his eyes.

I grab his hand, and pull him in the correct direction. I know the way back to town. Kind of.

I was never too good at finding my way around, but sometimes I get a tingly feeling that leads me in the right direction. I end up changing direction a few times as I take Boron with me, but I'm pretty sure it's the way back.
