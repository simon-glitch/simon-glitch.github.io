# Chapter 1
Narrator: Rosa

I remember that day so warmly. Well, it used to be kinda hard to remember, because I didn't really remember anything from that time, but I'm currently using a spell that lets me relive my old experiences, even if I don't remember them. Ah, doesn't that sound just absolutely wonderful? I can assure you, it really is. I bet you'd love to do that yourself and tell me all about the most wonderful times in your life. Anyways, um, I may as well narrate this for you.

@ Boron: Hey, what's going on here?

Oh, I'm ... recording all of the lovely details of my life, and our adventure.

@ Boron: Well, that sounds great.

Ooh! You should narrate the next chapter!

@ Boron: Chapter??

Yeah. I'm formatting it in a book for someone.

@ Boron: You sure do have some weird projects.

Hey! Don't act like you're the normal one here!

@ Boron: Okay, okay. I'll help narrate some of it for you.

Good boy. I new you'd understand. :D

Now, um... oh, right. I should be narrating.

### Alright, let's narrate this

The first time I met Boron, it wasn't magical, but it was very important. My mother had just died the day before. She was out shopping, and one of the racist people in town saw her and was really disgusted, because she was a troll. Us high trolls have always been seen as inferior beings with less intelligence than others, even though we're not really unintelligent at all. People just hate us because they are racist. Luckily, the man who killed my mother didn't know much about her and was not an immediate threat to me, as long as I didn't happen to randomly runinto him. The day my mother died, I cried myself to sleep, and felt horrible. Luckily, after waking up, I got super motivated to move on and get stronger, so I wouldn't like my mama did. So, I went to the neighboring town, and went to the adventurer's guild. That's where I met my very first friend.

I walked in, and it wasn't super busy. The 2 adventuers that were sitting at a table talking about their next quest went silent and glared at me, noticing that I am a troll.

"Oh, hi there." The receptionist said pretty plainly.

I was goin to respond, but then the entrance door suddenly opened. The adventurers jerked their heads in that direction, and glared at the boy that just walked in, which was Boron. After a mere second, the adventurers realized that me and Boron weren't really that important, and decided to continue talking about their quests. The receptionist dropped her shoulders a little and let out a sigh.

She looked directly at me. "Now, girl, what are you here for?"

"Me become adventurer, request."

"Huh?"

"Me become adventurer. Apply."

The receptionist did not like how simple my speech was. You see, I really wasn't very educated or good at speaking back in the day, so I was very hard to understand.

The receptionist frowned. "Okay. That will cost 10 silver."

I put 10 silver on the table. I'm kind of stressed, but that's because I'm not used to interacting with people.

The receptionist calmly places an adventurer card on the table. I grab one of the scalpels, and prick my finger to drop a drop of blood on it.

The boy behind me interrupts while I'm doing this. "I'd like to apply to."

The receptionist quickly pulls out another card, and holds it in the air. "Silver, please."

He quickly pays, as if this is a race between him and the receptionist. They are both smiling now. How cute. I just watch them mindlessly. My adventurer card is now complete, and has my name and stats on it.

The boy quickly drops a drop his blood on the card, using the scalpel I just used, instead of one of the other 20 of them, not that is matters. He then puts it in the empty jar labeled "dirty".

The receptionist puts the silver coins away, and looks at both cards, flipping them around.

"Wow, you two are bound for success. You should make a party."

The other 2 adventurers in the room stop talking for a moment and look our way. Then they go back to talking. They are now walking about another adventurer they've partied with before.

I look at the boy blankly, and then back at the receptionist. The boy looks at his card, and grimaces. He must have noticed how bad his stats are. All of his stats are 0, and he's level 1. He looks at mine, and notices the same thing. I remember why I'm here, and put my card in my pocket.

The boy thinks for a moment. He's pondering whether forming a party is a good idea.

"Good idea." He looks at my face, which was pointed at a painting on the wall.

"Um." He taps my shoulder, and I get a bit startled. I take a step back and look back at him.

"Do you want to join my party?"

"Ohhh wuhhh. Confirm." I have a hard time looking for the word, but agree.

He is a bit confusd though. "Huh?" He tilts his head. I nod slightly.

"Is she your sister or something?" The receptionist ask. The boy looks at her a bit sheepishly and a bit surprised.

I had not given her the best impression, and it would make perfect sense for him to bring his sister with him, or accompany his sister, is she was as awkward as I as.

"N-n-n-no." The boy sheepishly stuttered.

The receptionist sighed. She pulled out some papers and markers, and started making flyers for a public event.

The boy looked at me. "Will you join my party?" He asked harshly.

I sighed, relieving some stress, and gave him a confused look. I had assumed that he must have wanted something else (or course, I would have had no idea what, but I still felt like there was something else). After my sigh, I concluded that he was just asking me to join his party.

"Confirm. Positive."

The boy tilted his head in confusion. Unfortunately for him, I did not know the words "yes" or "no". The only words I knew were ones related to magic and spells. I was like that nerdy kid who is so awkward because he's not even used to using your vocabulary. Actually, nevermind that. I don't think the average nerd is as lacking in their vocab as I was in mine.

"Um, okay?" The boy sighed. Then he looked at the quest board and walked over. I stood in-place for a second, and then walked over to the board.

He looked at me, and I looked back. He thought for a second, and realized that I did want to be in his party. He then found an E rank quest to pick 300 magic herbs. He brought it over to the receptionist. "I'd like to accept this quest."

"Alright." The receptionist put it under her desk and continued working on her flyers.

The boy came over to me. "Come on." He gestured for me to follow him, so I did.

We walked out of town, and towards the nearby woods.

"So, who are you?" He asked.

I looked at him blankly, not understanding his question.

"Ugh. What is your name?" He asked after another moment.

"Name..." I thought for a moment. I recognized that word.

"Rosa." I recalled. My mother has used my name many times, but I've almost forgotten what the word "name" means.

"Hi Rosa. I'm Boron."

Unfortunately, I did not understand that, and just glanced at him.

"You're not very talkative, are you?" He asked with a frown.

I gave him a confused look. He sighed and shook his head.

We continued our walk into the forest.

The forest was dense, and the boy almost immediately tripped. I ran over to him, and grabbed his hand. He was a bit surprised by that, and tried to force my hand off him.

"Stabilize." I said. He gave me a bewildered look, and sighed. He stopped struggling, and I led him through the woods, making sure he didn't trip.

I let go of his hands when we got to large ditch with a bunch of roots that we could use to cross it. I turned around and watched him climb on the roots behind me. I helped stabilize him twice when he almost fell over.

"Thanks." He smiled after we finished crossing.
