Trolls have average magic ability. Magic is so common in my fantasy world that there is a wide variety of magic ability, and most creatures can cast basic spells.

I'm going to make all of the races different, with different abilities, and there will be lots of them, including a bunch of "monster races", which are races that have a monster form and a person form. Not all monsters have person forms though. For example, all cyclops are monsters.

Also, intelligence among all races is effectively equal, just to be fair. I don't like the idea of intellectual superiority. However, some races are better in certain areas of thinking, and naturally think differently.

Trolls specifically have average magic (mana), very good natural energy (which is magic related to natural things), and good cultivation (essentially eastern magic, or qi).

People can improve in 4 differents ways:
* training, which improves their natural energy
* cultivation, which improves their qi
* levelling up, which improves their lifeforce
* skills, which work like 'skills' in other fantasy settings

However, at the time the book is written, no one knows about the first 2 methods, and the 'appraisal' skill that people have can only see the last 2. This means many races are seen as inferior due to specializing in training or cultivation.
