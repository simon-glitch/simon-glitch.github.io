# Story
Boron and Rosa are the main characters of the story. The story focuses on their hardships, adventures, and life experience. They also have a relationship as spouses, which is developed throughout the story, but their romance is not the primary focus of the story. The primary focus is appreciating the beauty of life, the joy of living, and freedom.

## Style
I am hoping to use as many tropes as possible to make the story enjoyable. I will try to only use tropes that add something.

# Worldbuilding
The world is a medieval world with a magic system, like what a person could find in many pieces of fantasy media, such as *Dungeons and Dragons*, *Skyrim*, other RPGs, and fantasy stories, like *Lord of the Rings*.

Now, I'm mainly going to focus on things that I find truly enjoyable, such as Skyrim's many game mechanics that end up being oddly realistic while also being utterly broken. The story will not look like or feel like actual roleplay, such as *Dungeons and Dragons*, because I'm not very interested in that personally.

## Realism
Everything will have a lot of realism, but only the type of realism I think is important: daily life realism. No chemistry, or physics, or biology, or nasty science. In my experience, science isn't prevalent enough in my personal life, and there are so many beautiful things in my life that don't really require me to use my scientific knowledge. What's funny is I am a massive nerd who really loves science, but I've found that a lot of simpler things are more important.

All realism will be heavily focused on household chores, common social activities (the really common ones, not the more exotic ones), and people's emotions (emotions give life meaning, and I hope they will give my story some meaning too).

As I said, the realism will be extreme. I will specifically account for: going to bed, waking up, cooking, cleaning, eating, admiring things, entertainment, and daily schedules. A lot of writers account for these things nowadays, but my accounting will be more extreme. For example, people need to brush their teeth in my world.

Well, actually, the realism isn't that extreme. A lot of people really love this kind of stuff, and already know about it and talk about it.

## The magic system
There is no science in Elecharia. When a character survives a fall at a speed of 200 mph, that's because they used a spell. The magic has practically no limits.

The main features of the magic system are:
* physics follows Newton's laws and the laws of thermodynamics, but those laws are controlled by related energy types; manipulating these energies causes objects to move in opposition to those laws;
* all interactions between objects are controlled by energies; matter is not the same as "energy", but you can convert between the 2; there are a lot of energy types:
    * magic energy: this is used to cast spells;
    * elemental energy: this is created when spells are cast, and causes lingering effects; some natural processes also generate elemental energy; it is also easy to absorb;
    * sustenance: essentially, nutrition; living bodies use their organs to convert sustenance into energy; for example, muscles convert sustenance into physical energy;
    * physical energy: used to control the physics and thermodynamics mentioned before;
    * lifeforce: acts as a catalyst for energy conversions; also connects the body and mind;
    * natural energy: gives an object a natural presence; created as a biproduct of energy conversions; also created by lifeforce; also connects the body and soul;
    * mental energy: controls conversions related to magic energy; also connects the mind and soul;
* living things have 3 parts:
    * the body: the physical body; physical means it is directly effected by physical energy and follows the standard laws of physics, as long as the physical energy is not augmented;
    * the mind: controls mental energy;
    * the soul: is a "physical" thing, but is not effected by physical energies; it is effected by natural energy and mental energy; stores an image of the mind and body, and controls the natural energy in the body;
    * these 3 parts can be separated, and can also exist on their own; souls are just regular objects, but they react to various energy types differently than bodies and minds do;
* interactions between the body, mind, and soul, and the various energy types, can have somewhat arbitrary rules, just like chemistry in the real world; this means that I can use the magic system in my writings to do all kinds of different things;
* yes, I know chemistry is determined by quantum mechanics and a bunch of subatomic physics, but I'm not going to invent hard rules like that for me magic system;
* **just assume that whatever elementary or quantum physics would be required to make the things that happen in my story possible are already there;** I'm not a genius, but I do want my magic system to be very different from the science of our world;
* every field of science in our world is replaced by various interactions between various objects and magic energies in my magic system; this includes, for example, biology, geology, and meterology;
* finally, a lot of people do study magic in my world; so, for example, geologists in my world exist, and they study magic related to the formation of rocks and minerals;
