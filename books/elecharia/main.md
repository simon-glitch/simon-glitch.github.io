# Story
Cobalt and Foline are the main characters of the story. The story focuses on their hardships, their adventures, and their general experience. They are always shown as being spouses, but the story does not focus on romance, because I simply don't want to write a romance story.

## Style
I am hoping to use as many tropes as possible to make the story enjoyable.

# Worldbuilding
The world is a medieval world with a magic system, much like what a person could find in many fantasy books, in *Dungeons and Dragons*, and in other RPGs.
