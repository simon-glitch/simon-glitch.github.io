Here begins the epic adventures of a brave hero, named Kyogur.

## World Building
I was born into your standard western-style medieval world with western magic. That means there were dragons, and wizards, and spells with incantantions. However, magic is not some hand-wavey thing to me. It's a science. Of couse, when I was younger, I just accepted any magic I saw as part of the way the world is, not some strange elusive thing that you would only here of in a fairy tale.

So, in my magical home world, there was magic. People could easily cast spells by using paper parchments or speaking incantantions fluently enough. So, most tasks were accompanied with some form of magic, which we may as well call run-of-the-mill "work" with how abundant it was.

This means that even the process of my mother going through labor to birth me was aided by magic, much like how you world uses technology to make the process easier and reduce the risk of the death. Richer families would usually have a doctor who knew holy magic come in to assist, but my doctor only knew water magic. Still, water mages were perfectly good at preventing bleeding if the mother had to be ripped open in any spots, and they could even slow blood flow to help clot any internal bleeding. This is quite painful for the recipient of the magic, but at least it prevents death. My mother only got a couple of bruises and was able to heal within a month, which is a lot better than some of the stories I've heard.

Anyways, everything in my original world was aided by magic, but none of the magic in that world was **anything like** what I experienced on a "daily" basis. As an infant, I didn't really see the full picture and just had to suffer through the process, but I think you would agree that what I went through was bizarre and potentiall scary. For me, there were only a few scary parts, and it wasn't any worse than growing up.

... Oh, I'm sorry about that. What I just said was kind of abstract, wasn't it? You probably want to know the complete story, as specifically as possible. Well, we will have to go over each day 1 at a time. Why?

Well, *"a good life feels like it only lasts for a day, and a bad day feels like it lasts for a lifetime"*, or something like that. What was the quote again? Well, I think it might be true for me. Or maybe the opposite is true. I would love to claim that a good day feels like it lasts a lifetime, since for me, it seemingly does. Jokes and weird quotes aside, every time I go to sleep in my homeworld, I literally have to live through an entire life, and when I die in that life, I wake up in my homeworld again. Isn't that crazy?

### Pre
I was born. When I went to sleep, Life 1 (next section) began.

## Life 1
I'm glad this life was short, because shorter lives when I was younger would have meant less confusion. Well, I apparently watched someone get eaten alive by wolves, and then I sat in a cage for an hour, and then I was fed to the wolves. *Ugh,* what is wrong with the people in that world? Ohhh... wait, I remember them. We see them again in Life 304. Should I be telling you that? Probably not. I heard someone say I can't leave "hanger cliffs" in my diary or something. Whatever.

## Post 1
This is a Post section. It denotes when I wake up after a given life. So, this is Post 1. Keep in mind, I reincarnate in another world anytime I go to sleep in my homeworld, so that means I have had days where I lived multiple lives and therefore it wouldn't make much sense to sort each life by the day it occured in.

Like many babies, I woke up crying and wailing, however my mother had no way of knowing the scene I just had to watch.

## Life 2
I woke up in a forest, which was new. Well, **everything** was new. What I didn't notice was that I was actually a goblin. My instincts told me to try moving my limbs around a bit, so I did. And then I started hungering for food. Fun fact: mental age doesn't matter as far as instincts are concerned. If I reincarnate as an adult goblin, then I get whatever insticts they get. As I tried moving my limbs around, I ended up falling off the stump I was sitting on. That hurt, so I made a "gwehwegeeee!" sound. No one was around to help, which made me nervous and I started crying. Eventually, my instincts reminded me that I should move. With the pain, I wanted to run, which didn't help. I ended up pushing as many muscles as my brain could locate as hard as I could. This sent my right arm slamming into the stump I fell off. I strained my left foot as I pressed down on my right and I ended up bonking my face into a bush and pressing my face against its leaves. After wincing from the pain of hitting the stump and swinging my arms around again, I ended up with my face planed in the ground underneath the bush, which was a bit muddier and made it practically impossible to breathe. Eventually I realized that pressing my arms forward at least moved my body a bit off the ground. But it took me 30 seconds before I was actually able to breathe, and that hurt, **a lot**.

At this point, I was enraged and wanted to break things, but I was also terrified and wanted to run. Unfortunately, the only thing I was going to break in the mean-time was myself, and it's not trivial for an infant to learn to walk in one day, even when its instincts command it to.

Unfortunately for me, goblins are a little less intelligent than humans. Fortunately for me, they weren't stupid either.

My mind ran at a pretty average pace, but I found myself strongly compelled to focus on my muscles and to make noise.

"Cooo ... cocoa ... gugegi ... jah!"

I made nonsensical sounds as I rolled around on the ground, and tried to use all 4 of my limbs to fight against gravity. My logic was to keep my face from landing in the mud again. The forest wasn't very muddy in most spots, and I eventually got myself on my back. I looked up at the sky and realized that the nasty ground wasn't bugging me anymore. After a moment, I figured the sky would hit me in the face just like the ground did, so I tried pushing it away as well. After a few minutes, I realized that the sky is not the same as the ground.

At this point in time, I was full of fear, and it wasn't dissipating quickly. In my panic, I tried using more muscles and managed to get my self sitting up for a moment, before I rolled over again, and then I began rolling down a hill. I rolled and rolled, which felt like losing a serious fist fight with the ground. It really sucks, especially for a goblin with the mind of an infant who isn't familiar with anything. You would think the unknown would scare me, but I was completely neutral to it. Again, goblin instincts influenced my behavior more than my mind, and I couldn't feel any of my human instincts anymore.

When I stopped rolling, my head hit a rock and my nose bled. This was extremely painful, but fortunately did not knock me out. I think I would have gotten eaten by the wolves if I would have been knocked out.

*Wolves?*

Yes, wolves showed up 30 minutes later.

When my face hit the rock, I began scrambling to get off the rock, and as my arms and legs hit the rock, I noticed that staying still caused less pain than hitting the rock. Once I finally stopped moving my arms, I got curious and decided to touch the rock
