Here begins the epic adventures of a brave hero, named Kyogur.

## World Building
I was born into your standard western-style medieval world with western magic. That means there were dragons, and wizards, and spells with incantantions. However, magic is not some hand-wavey thing to me. It's a science. Of couse, when I was younger, I just accepted any magic I saw as part of the way the world is, not some strange elusive thing that you would only here of in a fairy tale.

So, in my magical home world, there was magic. People could easily cast spells by using paper parchments or speaking incantantions fluently enough. So, most tasks were accompanied with some form of magic, which we may as well call run-of-the-mill "work" with how abundant it was.

This means that even the process of my mother going through labor to birth me was aided by magic, much like how you world uses technology to make the process easier and reduce the risk of the death. Richer families would usually have a doctor who knew holy magic come in to assist, but my doctor only knew water magic. Still, water mages were perfectly good at preventing bleeding if the mother had to be ripped open in any spots, and they could even slow blood flow to help clot any internal bleeding. This is quite painful for the recipient of the magic, but at least it prevents death. My mother only got a couple of bruises and was able to heal within a month, which is a lot better than some of the stories I've heard.

Anyways, everything in my original world was aided by magic, but none of the magic in that world was **anything like** what I experienced on a "daily" basis. As an infant, I didn't really see the full picture and just had to suffer through the process, but I think you would agree that what I went through was bizarre and potentiall scary. For me, there were only a few scary parts, and it wasn't any worse than growing up.

... Oh, I'm sorry about that. What I just said was kind of abstract, wasn't it? You probably want to know the complete story, as specifically as possible. Well, we will have to go over each day 1 at a time. Why?

Well, *"a good life feels like it only lasts for a day, and a bad day feels like it lasts for a lifetime"*, or something like that. What was the quote again? Well, I think it might be true for me. Or maybe the opposite is true. I would love to claim that a good day feels like it lasts a lifetime, since for me, it seemingly does. Jokes and weird quotes aside, every time I go to sleep in my homeworld, I literally have to live through an entire life, and when I die in that life, I wake up in my homeworld again. Isn't that crazy?

## Life 1
I'm glad this life was short, because shorter lives when I was younger would have meant less confusion. Well, I apparently watched someone get eaten alive by wolves, and then I sat in a cage for an hour, and then I was fed to the wolves. *Ugh,* what is wrong with the people in that world? Ohhh... wait, I remember them. We see them again in Life 304. Should I be telling you that? Probably not. I heard someone say I can't leave "hanger cliffs" in my diary or something. Whatever.
