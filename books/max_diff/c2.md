## Discussion amongst the gods

Zevon: "Alright, looks like everyone is here ..." *frowns in disdain* "except for Alamech, as usual. Why is he always late?"

Tofurra made an evil smirk: "I suggest we punish him. I've been waiting for 20 million years!"

Gapratan: "Nononono1 Tofurra, we need to respect him, even his he is a pathetic astro-clutz."

Tofurra pouted and reluctantly accepted Gapratan's statement as the truth.

Zevon: "Well, if he doesn't show up then we can just let him miss out."

Aranook: "Wait, I feel his presence approaching right now."

Alamech panted as he ran through the Topaz Forest. Alamech eventually got to meeting room. All of the other gods looked at him with disgust and exasperation. They were all too familiar with him being late to their celestial meetings.

Tofurra sent an evil glare toward Alamech, a glare strong enough to kill any human within 100 feet: "For the record, I am quite fed up with your tardiness."

Alamech winced with some embarrassment: "Yeah, yeah. I know how much you love me."

Gapratan: "Stop bickering like that. We have more important matters to discuss."

Alamech: "Oh, by the way: would anyone like to know why I am late?"

Zevon: "Well, the official rules say we are supposed to discuss any instances of tardiness before the official discussions can begin."

Alamech: "Good. So, I'm late because I went to every world I could find and took out as many loans as possible."

The other 41 gods opened their eyes wide in shock. Some of them were clearly annoyed, because Alamech had taken out loans before and he was infamous for betting his borrowed money, losing his bets, and then not paying the loans back.

Zevon: "No! The last time you did that it crushed the global economies of 7 worlds."

Alamech: "Don't worry bro. This time I will be betting on something that I know will succeed!"

Zevon: "Part of me is afraid to hear what this is."

Alamech rubbed his hands together like an evil mastermind. He also grinned like an arrogant child, but he sees himself as a genius.

Alamech: "Unfortunately, my bet is related to the main topic of dicussion for this meeting!"

25 of the gods all start screaming. "No!" "Arghghg!!" "What is wrong with this guy!?" "Such a fool!" "Alamech!? More like Ala**crap**" "Why!? Jusy why..." "Funugufugullumana!!!!" "This!... Argh ... ughhh!!!"

Zevon: "Everyone! Get your minds together! We need to be rational."

Zevon told everyone to calm down.

Gapratan: "Well then. Let's discuss this."

All of the gods straightened their faces and uncrossed their arms to be more formal.

Zevon: "As you know, Deikine has selected a new hero to reincarnate. This hero survived the *Test of Attention* that was given by the *Great Translocator of Sentience*, Truck Kun."

"This hero selected difficulty setting 11, making her the first hero to ever go to the Elemental Dungeon World, Flamerice."

"Now, you all know our usual procedure. We shall place bets on whether the hero will make certain achievements."

"The achivements for flamerice are:"

* The ultimate test of puzzle solving -- Complete the puzzle dungeon Jigallon.
* The ultimate test of perseverance -- Defeat Zeyexow and complete the spirit dungeon, Eslelsey.
* The ultimate test of stabbing
* The ultimate test of jumping
* The ultimate test of swimming
* The ultimate test of mining
* The ultimate test of swordsmanship
* The ultimate test of bowmanship
* The ultimate test of smithing
* The ultimate test of surviving through the weather
* The ultimate test of machine operation
* The ultimate test of foresight
* The final ultimate test -- Defeat the omage-tier demon lord, Orokimb, and save the world from his destruction.

"Alright. Now feel free to use your soul-chi interfaces to make your bets and describe the amount you are betting."

Tofurra looked at Zenon with a bored expression: "Is there even a point in betting if we are all gonna bet on none of these achievements being made. Come on. We both know that normal humans can't even pass any of these tests. Only isekai heroes with overpowered abilities, and skilled individuals from long lineages of skilled individuals can pass even **one** of these tests. Are you really expecting a woman to do any of these? Especially one who is reincarnating with 25 challenges enabled. There's no way she could even pass the intermediate test of jumping, let alone the expert one or the ultimate one."

Alamech then excitedly spoke up before Zenon would respond: "Actually, I am betting against you."

Tofurra: "You can't seriously be telling me that not only did you take out hundreds of massive loans, but now you are going to make the worst possible bet."

Alamech: "Well, I'm not telling you that, since I don't see this as the worst possible bet in the slightest."

Tofurra: "Ughgh! Fine! How much are you betting?"

Alamech: "Well, I have 2.9 trillion cosmic coins, so I'll bet 223,076,000,000 coins on each of the achievements."

Many of the gods heard this any became exited by the opportunity to earn a lot of coins. Their facial expressions even tensed up and they started leaning forward.

Loluloli, the god of glyphs and symbols, transformed his eyes into giant dollar signs.

## $ w $

Alamech used his screen to place his bets and all of gods quickly turned on their screens. Within a few moments, everyone has bet tens of billions, and in some cases, trillions, on every one of the achievements. Multiple gods even called various interdimensional banks and asked them to offer more loans to Alamech. As this happened, Alamech took out thousands more loans, and distributed all of his loans across all of the achievements. Many of the gods even agreed to let their money be used to pay the interest on some of Alamech's loans, since they still knew they were guaranteed to make a profit on this.

The question of "How would Alamech pay for all of the loans if he lost this bet?" was completely disregarded, because no one cared. The gods all knew, or at least thought that they knew, that Alamech would be their slave for a long, looong time after this bet concluded. They were also confident that Deikine would come up with a way to extract the value from Alamech if they got desperate.

Alamech now had 763 trillion coins in bets placed, and the other gods had 12.4 quadrillion in bets placed against him.

Tofurra: "Alamech, how are you ever going to pay back all of your debts when you lose this bet?"

Alamech: "Come on. You already know that I think that I know that I am going to win."

The most cosmic money Alamech had ever made in one day was 24,000 coins. That means it would take him at least over 87 million years to pay back the debt. If you account for interest and inflation, it is more like 4.4e830502 years. That's a number with 800,000 digits, by the way!

Tofurra: "Well, we'll see I guess."

## It's an isekai story
I woke up in the middle of a forest.

My first concern was to check my own health and status, because I knew that that is very important to survival.

I saw that I had clean clothes on. When I checked underneath the clothes I was disappointed to find that I had reincarnated as a man. Well, I guess one of my perks said that I take on a male form after sunrise. I looked at the sky, which I could see through the leaves, and it was blue, just like you would expect it to be.

I was very happy that I had no injuries at least, but I still had plenty of things to grope about.

Now, this forest was a jungle, which is actually the best kind of forest. Jungles have an abundance of food, and some of their plants are useful as materials, such as vines, lichen, and moss.

The concerning part about jungles is that they tend to be inhabited by poisonous plants and animals, as well as dangerous predators.

I had no idea where I was, relative to anything other tha what I could see, and I had no idea how long my body had been in the jungle, so I figured that "now is as good a time as ever" and started exploring.

As I explored, I had to carefully manuever across the roots of trees, and avoid any bushes that might harbor snakes or dangerous insects.

I ended up seeing some giant hornets, which I swear were individualls as large human children and could fly at 30 miles per hour. I hid in some bushes when they flew by, and either they were not interested in me or didn't notice me. Either way, I'm glad I survived that brief encounter.

I kept exploring, and found an open area, where the grass was really short for some reason. You know how you have to mow your lawn every once in a while? Well, this field looked a lot like a mowed lawn, and those don't just naturally occur in the jungle.

I decided to back away from the clearing, and continue exploring the trees. This time I was slower and tried to be quiet, while staying on high alert. I knew that there might be other creatures or people around, and that they might not be friendly.

I didn't know if I was lucky before the clearing, or unlucky after the clearing, but the terrain seemed to have become less predictable, with more quicksand, mudpits, piles of sticks, and hidden roots. I almost tripped about 5 times every 30 minutes.

After an hour of travelling, I suddenly saw a small blue blob flying towards me. I blocked the ball with my elbow, but it hurt. Somehow it started out hard and then softened as it grabbed my elbow with an intense grip. Then I felt an itching, burning sensation, as if the blob was made of acid. The blob seemed to maintain a spherical shape, despite being squishy, and it was wriggling as if it was alive. Then I saw a pair of cute eyes appear on its surface, and a small purple ball appear near the center of the blob's body.

Me (thoughts): 'Oh, it\'s a slime, like in an RPG.'

The slime was starting to hurt my arm quite a bit, so I walked over to a tree and slammed my arm into a stubby branch that was sticking out of a tree. This seemed to damage the slime, because it got off my arm. I decided to run, and the slime began chasing me, by repeatedly hopping in my direction. I was only able to run for 15 seconds before I got tired, which surprised me. The slime was still chasing at a good speed. The way the slime compresses and then expands before it launches forward is quite strange. This also makes its gore glow and dim, which implies that it might be using some kind of magic to do the jump.

As I speed-walked away from the slime, I looked for any pit I could get the slime trapped in. I got lucky and saw what looked like a 3 foot drop. I stood in front of it, and let the slime jump towards me. Then I quickly stepped to the side and let the slime fall in the pit. I immediately picked up a large rock and dropped it on the slime. The slime seemed stuch under the rock, so I started stabbing at it with sticks and twigs. Eventually, the slime finally died.

Part of me wanted to just leave, but then I remembered:
* 'Slimes are common creatures in vidoe games and fantasy. Therefore, it might have some kind of drop or loot. I need to check. Of course, people also usually gain experience for killing monsters in games, and I didn't get an indicator of any experience, but I have no way of knowing how the experience works. The game *Skyrim* only gives the player experience for using skills. Dropping a rock on the slime and killing it with sticks might not count as using any skills and might not be registered as a skill anyways.'

While I thought about this, I picked up the rock, and searched around where it was. There, I only found the shattered shards of the slime's core.

Me (thoughts): 'Well, this is clearly that purple core. Hmm... I wonder what should I do with it?'

My stomach: "Grrr Gurgle Grrr!!!"

Me (thoughts): 'How am I already hungry? It's only been 2 hours. Well, I haven\'t seen any food, but I know in some RPGs the player can get food from monsters. Oddly enough, the slime didn\'t drop and of its goop / flesh. So, I guess the only potential food I have is its core fragments. Welp, I ain\'t got much to lose if I just eat it, right? Besides, there\'re only only 2 ways to find out whether something is edible: ask someone else or just eat it.'

After considering it and convincing myself, I decide to eat the slime core fragments. The core had shattered into 5 pieces which were roughly the same size. By the way, I should also clarify that the fragments were soft, and gooey on their edges, but firm and solid on the flat areas of their faces. It was kinda weird how they were seemingly designed to not have sharp points that could potentially harm anyone.

Me: "Ooooh woah! Yum! *Slurp* *Suck*"

The slime core fragments were so delicious that I had to scream about it. They tasted sweeter than pure sugar, kind of like an artificially sweetened pastry. They also had this nice warm feeling when they hit the back of my throat, and left a thin goo with a strong aftertaste in my mouth.

Me (thoughts): 'Wow! Are these things intended to be eaten or something?'

They also had a weird earthy flavor in the aftertaste, but I ignored that.

Unfortunately, 5 other slimes had heard my scream. Fortunately, they were just as dumb as the first slime. I grabbed a branch covered in tons of leaves and twigs as a shield, and started dodging the slimes. The slimes ended up destroying the small twigs and leaves on the branch very quickly as they repeatedly hit it, but I was able to control their movement with it.

Eventually, I managed to trick all 5 slimes into falling in the pit at once. I dropped the large rock down on them, but it only trapped 4 or them.

Fortunately, I was able to grab another branch and eventually trapped the 5th slime between part of the pit's wall and the rock. I then used more sticks to kill off the slimes, one by one. Unforunately, the slimes softened the sharp tips of the branches into smooth ends as soon as they hit them, and I needed a sharp tip to puncture their body and deal any damage to them. This meant that I had to use dozens of branches to kill off the slimes.

Me (thoughts): 'I guess I will have to start collecting sticks and branches, not for starting campfires, but for killing off all of these slimes.'

I then started eating the slime cores. I was really excited as I havested them. I decided I would harvest the cores from all 5 slimes and then eat them all in one go. I put the fragments on a tree stump I found nearby. The slime that had escaped from the roch and that I had to hold down with a branch had 8 fragments, which were larger than the fragments from the other slimes. The other 4 slimes has 3, 3, 5, and 6 fragments. It seemed that the size of their cores were different.

Me (thoughts): 'Maybe the slime with 8 fragments was stronger than the other slimes. Or maybe its core was in a better condition because it wasn\'t crushed by the rock.'

I wasn't sure how the slimes or their fragments worked, since I knew nothing about the world's ecolony and the anatomy of its creatures.
