## Discussion amongst the gods

Zevon: "Alright, looks like everyone is here ..." *frowns in disdain* "except for Alamech, as usual. Why is he always late?"

Tofurra made an evil smirk: "I suggest we punish him. I've been waiting for 20 million years!"

Gapratan: "Nononono1 Tofurra, we need to respect him, even his he is a pathetic astro-clutz."

Tofurra pouted and reluctantly accepted Gapratan's statement as the truth.

Zevon: "Well, if he doesn't show up then we can just let him miss out."

Aranook: "Wait, I feel his presence approaching right now."

Alamech panted as he ran through the Topaz Forest. Alamech eventually got to meeting room. All of the other gods looked at him with disgust and exasperation. They were all too familiar with him being late to their celestial meetings.

Tofurra sent an evil glare toward Alamech, a glare strong enough to kill any human within 100 feet: "For the record, I am quite fed up with your tardiness."

Alamech winced with some embarrassment: "Yeah, yeah. I know how much you love me."

Gapratan: "Stop bickering like that. We have more important matters to discuss."

Alamech: "Oh, by the way: would anyone like to know why I am late?"

Zevon: "Well, the official rules say we are supposed to discuss any instances of tardiness before the official discussions can begin."

Alamech: "Good. So, I'm late because I went to every world I could find and took out as many loans as possible."

The other 41 gods open their eyes wide in shock. Some of them are clearly annoyed, because Alamech has taken out loans before and he is infamous for betting his borrowed money, losing his bets, and then not paying the loans back.

Zevon: "No! The last time you did that it crushed the global economies of 7 worlds."

Alamech: "Don't worry bro. This time I will be betting on something that I know will succeed!"

Zevon: "Part of me is afraid to hear what this is."

Alamech rubs his hands together like an evil mastermind. He grins like an arrogant child, but he sees himself as a genius.

Alamech: "Unfortunately, my bet is related to the main topic of dicussion for this meeting!"

25 of the gods all start screaming. "No!" "Arghghg!!" "What is wrong with this guy!?" "Such a fool!" "Alamech!? More like Ala**crap**" "Why!? Jusy why..." "Funugufugullumana!!!!" "This!... Argh ... ughhh!!!"

Zevon: "Everyone! Get your minds together! We need to be rational."

Zevon tells everyone to calm down.
