## Discussion amongst the gods

Zevon: "Alright, looks like everyone is here ..." *frowns in disdain* "except for Alamech, as usual. Why is he always late?"

Tofurra made an evil smirk: "I suggest we punish him. I've been waiting for 20 million years!"

Gapratan: "Nononono1 Tofurra, we need to respect him, even his he is a pathetic astro-clutz."

Tofurra pouted and reluctantly accepted Gapratan's statement as the truth.

Zevon: "Well, if he doesn't show up then we can just let him miss out."

Aranook: "Wait, I feel his presence approaching right now."

Alamech panted as he ran through the Topaz Forest. Alamech eventually got to meeting room. All of the other gods looked at him with disgust and exasperation. They were all too familiar with him being late to their celestial meetings.

Tofurra sent an evil glare toward Alamech, a glare strong enough to kill any human within 100 feet: "For the record, I am quite fed up with your tardiness."

Alamech winced with some embarrassment: "Yeah, yeah. I know how much you love me."

Gapratan: "Stop bickering like that. We have more important matters to discuss."

Alamech: "Oh, by the way: would anyone like to know why I am late?"

Zevon: "Well, the official rules say we are supposed to discuss any instances of tardiness before the official discussions can begin."

Alamech: "Good. So, I'm late because I went to every world I could find and took out as many loans as possible."

The other 41 gods opened their eyes wide in shock. Some of them were clearly annoyed, because Alamech had taken out loans before and he was infamous for betting his borrowed money, losing his bets, and then not paying the loans back.

Zevon: "No! The last time you did that it crushed the global economies of 7 worlds."

Alamech: "Don't worry bro. This time I will be betting on something that I know will succeed!"

Zevon: "Part of me is afraid to hear what this is."

Alamech rubbed his hands together like an evil mastermind. He also grinned like an arrogant child, but he sees himself as a genius.

Alamech: "Unfortunately, my bet is related to the main topic of dicussion for this meeting!"

25 of the gods all start screaming. "No!" "Arghghg!!" "What is wrong with this guy!?" "Such a fool!" "Alamech!? More like Ala**crap**" "Why!? Jusy why..." "Funugufugullumana!!!!" "This!... Argh ... ughhh!!!"

Zevon: "Everyone! Get your minds together! We need to be rational."

Zevon told everyone to calm down.

Gapratan: "Well then. Let's discuss this."

All of the gods straightened their faces and uncrossed their arms to be more formal.

Zevon: "As you know, Deikine has selected a new hero to reincarnate. This hero survived the *Test of Attention* that was given by the *Great Translocator of Sentience*, Truck Kun."

"This hero selected difficulty setting 11, making her the first hero to ever go to the Elemental Dungeon World, Flamerice."

"Now, you all know our usual procedure. We shall place bets on whether the hero will make certain achievements."

"The achivements for flamerice are:"

* The ultimate test of puzzle solving -- Complete the puzzle dungeon Jigallon.
* The ultimate test of perseverance -- Defeat Zeyexow and complete the spirit dungeon, Eslelsey.
* The ultimate test of stabbing
* The ultimate test of jumping
* The ultimate test of swimming
* The ultimate test of mining
* The ultimate test of swordsmanship
* The ultimate test of bowmanship
* The ultimate test of smithing
* The ultimate test of surviving through the weather
* The ultimate test of machine operation
* The ultimate test of foresight
* The final ultimate test -- Defeat the omage-tier demon lord, Orokimb, and save the world from his destruction.

"Alright. Now feel free to use your soul-chi interfaces to make your bets and describe the amount you are betting."

Tofurra looked at Zenon with a bored expression: "Is there even a point in betting if we are all gonna bet on none of these achievements being made. Come on. We both know that normal humans can't even pass any of these tests. Only isekai heroes with overpowered abilities, and skilled individuals from long lineages of skilled individuals can pass even **one** of these tests. Are you really expecting a woman to do any of these? Especially one who is reincarnating with 25 challenges enabled. There's no way she could even pass the intermediate test of jumping, let alone the expert one or the ultimate one."

Alamech then excitedly spoke up before Zenon would respond: "Actually, I am betting against you."

Tofurra: "You can't seriously be telling me that not only did you take out hundreds of massive loans, but now you are going to make the worst possible bet."

Alamech: "Well, I'm not telling you that, since I don't see this as the worst possible bet in the slightest."

Tofurra: "Ughgh! Fine! How much are you betting?"

Alamech: "Well, I have 2.9 trillion cosmic coins, so I'll bet 223,076,000,000 coins on each of the achievements."

Many of the gods heard this any became exited by the opportunity to earn a lot of coins. Their facial expressions even tensed up and they started leaning forward.

Loluloli, the god of glyphs and symbols, transformed his eyes into giant dollar signs.

Alamech used his screen to place his bets and all of gods quickly turned on their screens. Within a few moments, everyone has bet tens of billions, and in some cases, trillions, on every one of the achievements. Multiple gods even called various interdimensional banks and asked them to offer more loans to Alamech. As this happened, Alamech took out thousands more loans, and distributed all of his loans across all of the achievements. Many of the gods even agreed to let their money be used to pay the interest on some of Alamech's loans, since they still knew they were guaranteed to make a profit on this.

The question of "How would Alamech pay for all of the loans if he lost this bet?" was completely disregarded, because no one cared. The gods all knew, or at least thought that they knew, that Alamech would be their slave for a long, looong time after this bet concluded. They were also confident that Deikine would come up with a way to extract the value from Alamech if they got desperate.

Alamech now has 763 trillion coins in bets placed, and the other gods has 12.4 quadrillion in bets placed against him.
