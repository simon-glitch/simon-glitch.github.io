# Chapter 3
## The beginning of a night that doesn't want to end

At this point in time, I was overjoyed. Being back in my original body felt a lot better than any of those slime core fragments tasted. It just feels so right to be back in my original body, and the male body just felt kinda ... wrong. Hopefully you understand what I am saying here.

I held one of the blue slime's core fragments in my hand, and really questioned whether I should eat it. My emotions were all over the place, especially now that my injuries had been healed and my body had been given back.

Me (thoughts): 'If I eat this, it might taste so good that I will be screaming all night along, assuming that the flavor gets better as the slime gets stronger. i.e. assuming their is a positive correlation between fragment flavor and slime strength. Okay, that double alliteration was kinda cool.'

'Well, if I shout, it shouldn\'t be a big deal. Now that my injuries are healed, I can afford to add a few more. Heeheehee, har har har. Obviously, I don\'t want to do that. It would take so long for the injuries to heal. Also, if I am not mistaken, the injuries will return when I return to my male body during the day. Hmm... that sounds like it might not be so fun. I should see if I can get some supplies, and set up some kind of a shelter for the day. It\'s just bruises and scratches, so it\'s not too bad, but I still want to be able to relax and heal. Well, I guess I have a lot of things to think about and focus on.'

'Also, is it just me, or are the days here shorter than normal? You see, I\'ve been awake for only 6 hours, I think, and it\'s already night time. My sense of time is usually spot on like a bullseye on a dart board, so I can be sure either I woke up later in the day or the days are shorter. Considering how cloudy it was, the former possibility might be the true one.'


For next commit message:
* well, I said a few rough drafts, but I might only make 1; and I plan on editing chapters 1 at a time, unless I see some weird reason to rewrite the whole novel
* if this gets super popular, maybe I could consider making proper drafts of the whole novel, but I don't think this will get popular
* and yeah, I really do prefer keeping chapters as individual as possible, because I will probably only need to change minor things

For commit message after that:
* okay, I gotta big problem with writing lots of stuff in commit messages like its some kind of diary
* well, it's basically an unorganized way to say what I want to say, and that's kind of nice when I don't feel like going through a lot of extra work
* also, this stuff really comes straight from the heart, so maybe it really is a good thing; and maybe I should just go put this in the actual diary somewhere LOL
* bro, I just mis spelled "got a" as "gotta" LOL
* mis spelled, LOL
* dyslexia I guess?
