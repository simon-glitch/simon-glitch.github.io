# Chapter 1
(Leo's perspective)

One day, my life took an unexpected turn. It was all so sudden, too.

I was going about my daily life, attending my classes at school and distaster struck. An armed shooter had entered the school, and we went into lock down. Everyone was terrified, and they had a good reason to be. The worst thing you can imagine happened. The shooter came to our classroom and picked the lock on the door. Of course, the locks on the doors are pretty easy to pick. I know this, because I've had many occasions where I helped other students get something that they left in the classroom and the door was locked. Anyways, I knew I couldn't just let the shooter go on a killing rampage, so I did the logical thing - the right thing to do. I went to the door, holding a heavy object, and threw a calculated swing at the shooter as he came in. Of course, the shooter wasn't stupid. He started firing off rounds the instant the door was open. I don't know *what* happened to everyone else that day, because I died in the process. But what I do know is that I hit the shooter stick of hard wood, which someone had brought into class for an art project earlier that week.

What I do know, is that I saved dozens of my fellow students from getting injured and killed by the shooter. I guess that makes me a hero then? Well, I don't like to see myself as the hero. Life's not about being the hero; it's about doing the right thing. And I think I did the right thing in that moment. I died without any regrets. To be honest, I'm a little proud of myself, for fullfilling my duty as a just and morally grounded human being.

Luckily (or not so luckily, depending on how you look at it) for me, my life was not over. When I died, I woke up in an unfamiliar place. I still have this feeling in my heart like I just died and was reincarnated.

Here I am now, standing in what appears to be some kind of medieval throne room. And there's a bunch of dudes in hooded robes with really cool looking staffs. Are they wizards or something? Is this a fantasy world? I look around, and also see a bunch of knights (or are they royal guards?), what seems to be a king (he's got a crown after all), and ... it looks like some other people were reincarnated with me. They're all wearing very modern clothing: T-shirts, sweat pants ... there's this really cute blonde girl in jeans ... she look's like the definition of a country girl.

Oh, it looks like the wizards are leaving.

Then, as I was expecting, the king starts speaking.

King: Greetings, Heroes! I am King Ethanos. You have been summoned via an ancient ritual in order to defeat the demon king. Don't be afraid. You can relax. You are here to help us and we are here to help you.

The king smiles warmly at us.

King: You see this crystal ball here?
He points at a crystal ball.
King: Walk up here, one at a time, and touch it. The ball will display your stats and skills for everyone to see. The Goddess has blessed you all with powerful abilities in order to help you slay the demon king and save the world!

You know, this really sounds like some kind of Isekai story nonsense. I take the initiative.

Me: I'll go first!

I put my hand on the ball, and it glows for a moment. Then it suddenly manifests some kind of video-game like popup or UI.

```
Leonardo - Human - 17 Years Old

Job: Sanic

Skills:
- Speedrunning
    - Gotta go fast!
```

Ok, the fact that my official job title is "Sanic" seems to be some kind of weird joke. Am I just a part of someone's silly isekai fantasy story? Let's not overthink it!

King Ethanos: These are your stats. You can also chant "open status" in order to see them at any time.

Oh, cool.

Me: Open Status!
I decide to try it immediately, and I immediately see another popup. This one is much more detailed. It tells my stats, like `HP`, `MP`, `SP`, `STR`, `SPD`, `DEX`, and other stuff that looks like it came right out of *Dungeons and Dragons* or something.

Apparently I have `1500 SPD` and only `5` in every other stat. I guess that makes sense, considering my skill is speedrunning. I think `SPD` is short for "speed", at least.

As I think this, I watch all of the other heroes step up to the ball and have their status read.

However, as each of their skills are checked, the king seems to become more and more ... disappointed. He looks like he's going to throw up or something. He's really not liking any of their skills. I think he was expecting us to be like Sword Kings or Dragon Sorcerors or something crazy like that. But everyone's skill is super laid back and unique instead.

Alice's skill is memory sharing. Which sounds really cool, to be honest. Alice herself looks like a really sweet and empathetic girl. I don't know why, but I'm getting strong nice girl vibes from her.

James's skill is skill sharing. That doesn't seem useful if that's his only skill, since he doesn't have any other skills to share. Am I missing something here?

Kelsie's skill is transmorhping. She can morph into any creature she's cuddled with before. Okay, that's an awesome ability. She has this giant smile on her face, and her eyes are glowing. It's kind of impressive just how excited she clearly is about it. She must really like animals or something. In fact, is that a dog hair I see on her shirt? She definitely looks like a pet owner. Kelsie is the blonde girl I mentioned earlier. Those jeans she's wearing look like the kind of thing a country girl would wear, so she can deal with the wildlife. Also, the way she walks ... she looks like she's ready to wrestly with a grizzly bear or a small lion.

Piccolo's skill is magical vision. He can see through "obstructions". So he has X-ray vision? Okay, that sounds kinda gross. He is squinting his eyes and looking at the wall. I wonder if he can see outside. I hope he doesn't use that ability to look underneath anyone's clothes. Piccolo is cute, and short. I would guess he's from indonesia, just going by his race.

Fiona's skill is ... being a woman I guess? It seems like her skills are a stereotypical, sexist definition of what the average woman is. Her skills are:
* The power to give birth. Yeah, that makes sense, considering she's a woman. But does that mean other women in this world ... can't give birth? No, it must mean something else.
* Finding things. Yeah, a lot of women are good at finding stuff ... but that's just a stereotype. I guess she is like ultra good at it or something???
* House cleaning. Seriously, these skills would be offensive to me if I was a girl.
Fiona seems really content with this.

Fiona: Oh, I just get to be myself? That's awesome!

Oh, I guess she was already good at those things. That's kinda weird ... it's almost like she wasn't given any skills. And she's clearly totally fine with that. Fiona looks like the kinda woman you would imagine your mother to be. She looks strong, protective, safe, and confident. She looks like she could save the world if she needed to. I'm feeling this motherly glow from her. She looks so mature, yet she's clearly a teenager. Actually, the text box said she is 19 years old, apparently. Anyways, Fiona does seem like a bit of role model for the kind of person we should all be.

----

I guess I should describe the king's visual appearance too. He looks old ... like, really old. He makes your grandpa's grandpa look like a baby. He has a beard that's 3 feet long, and he has wrinkles as deep as Mount Everest is tall. And those stone cold eyes ... I think they have red irises, but that might be my perception lying to me. He is very angry right now, and I wouldn't be surprised if you told me he is actually the so called "demon king" in disguise. I definitely don't trust this dude. I know you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover ... but when the book is titled "How to eat your neighbor's children and get away with it", and it looks like it was created by a witch and a demon working together, maybe you should look for another book.

The king: Arghhh!!! None of you have any combat abilities?! None of these abilities will even have a significant impact on the well-being of our country. Pathetic!
* You! [the king points at his guards] Slaughter all 6 of the summoned isekai heroes. Show them no mercy. They are all useless anyways.

Okay, I think the king is actually evil.

The other 5 all look at each other, as their faces fill with fear.

Kelsie: We are going to die!

James: I hope I am at least reborn elsewhere.

Piccolo: Ah, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Fiona: What is wrong with you?!

Fiona looks at the king with clear disappointment.

I chant "open status" in my head, and read the detailed description for my skill.

```
Speedrunning:
* clip through walls
* equip armor and weapons in impossible ways
* have insane precision in your movements
* process information faster during battle
* easily stun and surprise enemies
```

After reading this, I realize I can stop the king's guards in their tracks and rescue everyone. I'm not afraid of dying, so I may as well put my life on the line again. It's the **right** thing to do, afterall.

I rush over to one of the guards and glare him down.

The other guards are surprised and freeze.

I jump the guard and he tries to block me with his sword. As my heart starts racing, I feel like everything goes in slow motion. I kick the guard in the face, and his body is knocked back 3 feet. His sword and shield are also both flung out of his hands. I think about using the sword to take care of the other guards, and my arm just magically grabs the sword on its own. I look at the shield and watch it fly into the king's face.

Ouch! That's gotta hurt like hell. First, it smacks him in the face, and then he trips on it as it falls and ends up slamming his balls directly onto it. I can tell he has balls because he makes an extra agonized and pitiful face when that happens. Welp, he doesn't have balls anymore XD.

Me: Listen up, you fools! I will have your heads if you don't stop now. We might *seem* useless, yeah, you heard me right. But it is a lot better to have useless people than cruel people. Do you people really want to commit such a horrible crime and kill us? You are just following the king's orders. I understand that. But don't you have the guts to follow your own morals? Aren't you sheep if you just blindly follow orders?

I make a speech while I have the guards attention.

Then the guards get over their shock and all charge at me.

One of the guards speaks up: we swore our loyalty to the king! You can never break that no matter how hard you try!!!

Me: Oh well. I see you're all a bunch of heartless monsters. So be it! Let the massacre begin!
Thanks to the speedrunning ability, I'm able to use the sword as well as a grandmaster, even though I've never held a sword before.

I attack all of the guards at the same time, but it's no big deal. Everything enters slow motion again, and I am able to quickly take them out one by one. Somehow, my sword can cut right through their armor like butter. Actually, my hand is somehow being directed to the joints in the armor where it's the weakest.

When I'm done killing the guards, I start walking towards the king, ready to confront him too.

Piccolo: Leonardo! If we stay here we'll all die! We need to run out of here immediately.
Piccolo runs over to the door and gestures for everyone else to follow.

James notices this immediately and follows suit. James looks back at the other 3 heroes, who are still frozen in shock.
James: come on! No time for dilly-dallying!
James's voice echoes like a lion's roar in the room. He really has the voice of a leader.

The other heroes hear him and immediately dash over to the door. I follow suit soon after, and the 6 heroes run for their life.

As we run, we see the walls start to move. The room gets smaller and smaller. And...

Boom! The room implodes and dust is flung everywhere.

I guess Piccolo was right.

Me: It is a good thing that we ran.
Piccolo: That was a trapped room. There was a red glowing gem at the end of the room, which activated the implosive spell. I wish you guys had noticed it sooner.

Piccolo suddenly starts running again and we all follow, trusting him to know what he's doing.

James: Leo, I have an idea. I'll use `Skill Sharing` to share the skill `Skill Sharing` with you, and then you can use it to share your `Speedrunning` skill with all of us.

Leo: Okay, good thinking, James.

After receiving the `Skill Sharing`, I then share the `Speedrunning` skill with everyone else, including James. I can see everyone's face change as they realize that time is slowing down around us (because we are all speeding up). Now I can actually feel comfortable and run at full speed with everyone else. We all run out of the castle like a flash of lightning. Every guard we pass by ends up seeing us, just barely, and their eyes seem to fill with surprise. I can't blame them though.

Once we finally escape from the castle, we see that the castle is in the middle of a huge city.

Piccolo: let's hide in that alley way.

Piccolo points towards a dark and inconspicuous alley.

James: I think that's a good idea.

We all stop in the alley way, and everyone else tries to catch our breaths. I think we are all exhausted due to our low level-1 stats. I feel okay, since I was actually a cross country runner at my school. Kelsie also seems to be faring well, but I think that's just because she is fit.

Piccolo: my magic eye told me that most people apparently don't even know that this alley way exists.

Fiona: Ha! Did we all run through a wall earlier!?

Kelsie: Huff! Yeah, we did!

Me: It's part of the speedrunning ability. You know how you can clip through walls in video games? Apparently my skill can do that too.

Piccolo: When we were in the throne room, I used my magic eye ability to see the future. I realizes that Leonardo wouldn't be able to kill the king. I saw a vision where fi we all stayed there, we would have been killed by the trap.

Me: Well, at least we survived.
Fiona: Takes deep breath. I feel light-headed.
James: You guys are pretty powerful even though your level is low. Are you sure you are useless, like the king said?
Alice: I can share memories with other people.
Kelsie: I can morph into any animal.
Fiona: I just like being myself.

James: Alright, let's not boast what we already know to each other. Even though understanding how our skills work is very useful, I guess.

Leonardo: James, I just realized something. You can share your `Skill Sharing` power with **all** of us. That means we can all share our skills with each other as long as you're around.

Kelsie: Put that way, I think we will be fine as long as we stick together.

James: Yes! Teamwork is of the utmost importance. Well, second to safety. We all need to stay together, at least for now.

Kelsie: James, you really do sound like a leader!

James: Aw, thanks.
James smiles at Kelsie and even blushes a little.

James: Let's discuss our next plan. We need to find somewhere safe to live and we need to learn more about this world we are in.

Piccolo: Well then, it would be a good idea to move out somewhere where we are not known criminals.

Kelsie: Yeah, I think the king and the city guards will be out to kill us in a few minutes.

James: Kelsie, you should try morphing into an animal, and look for a map of the surrounding area.

Fiona: actually, I already know where you can find that.

James and Kelsie: Really?

Fiona: I used my power to find things. It's 300 yards that way. There is a merchant who sells watermelons. It's on the wall right behind the counter.

Kelsie: Well, I'll try transforming into a squirrel then!

Kelsie closes her eyes and her body starts to glow.

Alice: she's cuddled with squirrels before?

Kelsie morphs into a squirrel. Then she squeaks back at Alice.

Leonardo: I think she just said yes.

Kelsie then runs off in the direction that Fiona pointed.

After a little while, Kelsie returns with a map of the surrounding area.

James: Great work, Kelsie.

Kelsie then transforms into her human form, and shares the map with us.

Fiona suddenly grabs her by the shoulders and shakes her.
* Kelsie! You can't go stealing other people's stuff.

James: Yeah, but we have more pressing matters to worry about.

Piccolo: Don't worry, I don't think these maps cost that much anyways.

James picks up the map and starts reading it.

James: It seems like there is a village to the north of here. Also, it seems to not be a very long walk from here.

Me: A village sounds perfect. We can lay low there for a while.

James: Well then! Let's get going. Piccolo, you go in front, since you can tell which spots are the least likely to have the guards notice us. Leo, you go in the back and watch our backs. You'll be our distraction if anything dangerous happens. Everyone else, stay between me and Leo.

Our group gets in formation and carefully starts walking towards the edge of the city.

As we walk, everyone takes the opportunity to do some sight seeing.

Piccolo's ability to gauge which places are safe ends up being flawless, so we are never noticed by any of the guards. Some citizens do look at us funny though, since our modern attire is vastly different from the attire of this fantasy world.

Eventually, we reach the city wall.

Piccolo: This things is 10 feet thick, you guys.

James: Well, hopefully Leo's `speedrunning` ability can clip through it,

Leo: Alright, give me the `skill sharing`.

James shares `skill sharing` with me again, and I share `speedrunning` with everyone else again. Then we all start trying to clip through the wall. It takes us each about a dozen tries, and Fiona in particular has a very hard time.

James: Fiona, please forgive me for this...

Fiona: Wha?!

James has to punch her in the back really hard in order to make her clip through. Then he comes through himself.
Now that we're finally out of the city, we can calmly walk towards the village.

Fiona: Ow, James! That hurt! You can't hit a woman like that!

James: I'm sorry, but sacrifices have to be made.

Fiona pouts at him. Then Alice gives her a hug.
* Alice: Don't worry, it'll all be okay.

Our group starts to walk through the woods to the north and reaches the village after 40 minutes. `Speedrunning` seems to have a slight effect on them during the walk, but it gets weaker over time. I guess `skill sharing` only shares a skill for a limited time, which makes sense if you think about it.

Upon arrival, we see that Acacia *(that's the name of the village)* is an average sized village. I see both humans and demi-humans.

Kelsie: Oh, this place looks so cuteeee! There is even a flower field up ahead! I want to explore there!

Piccolo: Kelsie, you should not explore here.
Piccolo gives a grim frown.

Kelsie: Aw, why not? It looks so peaceful.

Piccolo: If you go there, a group of orcs will kidnap you and make you their seedbed!

Kelsie's face immediately fills with dread.
* Kelsie: I-is that true?
* She whispers to Alice.
Alice: Well, if Piccolo said it then it must be true, right?

Kelsie stares at the flower field warily.

Suddenly, a person suddenly bumps into James.
