This book is written in a more readable shakespearean format. That means dialon is put in bullet points, with a label of who the speaker is above it. I find this to be the easiest to write. If I feel like it, I might use words like "says", "asks", and "interjects" if I feel they fit in.

Also, I should clarify that (as of 7:42 PM, February 10, 2024), some of chapters 1 and 2 was written with AI assistnace. I should clarify though: the AI was not ultimately very helpful, and I ended up writing most of it on my own anyways.
