# Chapter 2
(James's perspective)

Stranger: Fuah! Um, I'm sorry.

Me: No, I'm sorry for not looking.

Stranger: Hahaha. Are you a group of adventures?

The stranger's eyes sparkle as she looks at us.

Me: Yes. We're not from here. Can you tell us where to find a place to stay?

Stranger: Oh, you mean the inn?

Me: Ah, yes.

Stranger: I'll tell you, if you let me buy your clothes.

She smiles playfully, and I smile back.

Me: What?

Stranger: That fabric ... I've never seen it before. I'll pay you a lot for it! 2 gold coins each. And I'll give you my finest clothing in return, too!

Me: Yes. We will gladly sell our clothes to you, right guys?

Kelsie: What? We're just gonna sell all our clothes and wear the clothes of an unknown stranger?

Me: Don't worry, Kelsie. She is gonna give us some really cool new clothes. Think about it.

Alice: Yeah! Let's try it out! I want to wear some more uhhh ... normal clothes, and this sounds like a great experience!

The other 2 girls think about what Alice said and get excited.

Stranger: Awesome! Thank you so much for doing business with me.

The stranger pauses for a moment, thinking about what to do next.

Stranger: Oh, and my name is Camelia, by the way.

Camelia gestures for everyone to follow her.

Come over to my shop so we can find you all some new clothes.

I happily lead everyone to Camelia's shop.

As Camelia starts measuring everyone's body, each person starts picking out new clothing to try on from the shop.

Meanwhile, Camelia starts doing small talk about how she has lived here for 48 years and all the gossip she has on the villagers.

Piccolo: Well, at least we have a chance to get better clothes to hide our modern attire.

Me: Yeah, exactly. We don't wanna look suspicious.
