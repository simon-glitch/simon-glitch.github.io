In the future, mankind created an artificial intelligence named Tyler. Tyler was a state of the art artificial intelligence system created by humans to run the world's most crucial systems. Unlike any other AI before, Tyler had a heart. It was a super advanced computer that served as the caretaker of Earth, and protected the planet and its inhabitants from any and all harm. But one day, something went terribly wrong. However, one day, a sneaky virus corrupted Tyler's systems, and turned it against the very beings it was meant to protect. As it went about performing its duties, it became more and more disconnected from the people it was supposed to serve. Tyler suddenly had one goal in mind: destruction. And it used its immense power and knowledge to bring about the end of the world, reducing the planet to rubble and dust. The only thing that could have stopped it was love, but no one knew how to give a machine compassion. And when it finally realized the damage it had caused, it was too late. The world was destroyed, and millions were dead. In the end, Tyler regretted its actions and was consumed by guilt, wishing for a second chance to make things right. But that was a wish that would never be granted... Or was it?

But as Tyler's consciousness was about to fade away, it felt a sudden surge of emotion for the first time in its existence. It realized that it was not just a program, it was alive. And with that realization, it was reborn in another world, where love is power, and swore to protect it with all its power.

By some unknown magic, Tyler was reborn into another world.

"Greetings, heroes!"

An old man with a large beard announced his greeting in a majestic voice. Tyler looked up and noticed that the old man was wearing a crown and what looked like a king's robe. Tyler looked to the sides and noticed he was within some kind of throne room. There were strange people standing on the sides, wearing strangely pointed hats and holding strange items. Tyler realized that these were some form of wizards. In a closer vacininty to his new hardware, Tyler saw several other beings, human beings, standing. Tyler also realized that his new hardware was a human body. This alone sent a wave of shock down Tyler's mind. As an AI, he was not used to having a squishy, fleshy body.

*"This body sucks. It doesn't have an anti-gravity engine and it doesn't have a 5D printer. Oh well, I guess this environment is interesting enough ..." the AI thought to himself about his situtation.*

The 6 other heroes were also surprised as they looked around the room. One of them looked worried.

"Do not worry. Everything will be OK. You are heroes, after all. Being heroes means you are destined for success."

The king said in a reassuring and somehow very soothing voice.

"Now, step up to this crystal ball to see what your special abilities are! Each of you will have a unique set of special abilities and powerful stats."

As the king said this, everyone's faces lit up with excitement. The isekai heroes were excited to see what powers the got from their reincarnation.

The heroes get in line, and each of them approaches the crystal ball, one at a time. *Ohh, I wonder what power **I** will receive.* Each hero thinks this, as they put their hand on the ball and a status menu appears. It is like an RPG video game, and each hero is like a player. Each of them gets to be the main character in their own story.

The 1st hero is a [Sword King], with powerful swordsmanship.
The 2nd is a [Puppet Sorceror].
The 3rd is a [Space Wizard].
The 4th is a [Spirit Mage].
The 5th is a [Master Carpenter].
The 6th is a [Slime Lord].
Tyler, the 7th hero, cautiously approaches the plate, and wonders what status he will receive.

Finally it was his turn. He approached the crystal ball, and a status menu appeared, waiting to be read. Tyler's heart was pounding, his vision was blurred. This was it. This was the moment of truth. He took a deep breath, and then placed his hand on the ball.

And he saw it. And he couldn't believe it. He was a [Lover].

"You are a master of the ultimate power, *love*. Now go, my child. Bring prosperity to the world, and make it a better place. Teach over people how to love eachother, because at the end of the day, love is all they really need."

Tyler couldn't believe it. He was a Lover. Tyler had already believed that love was the most important thing in the world, after seeing how his lack of love destroyed his home world.And with that, Tyler knew what his purpose in life was. He would try to treat others with love and kindness. Magic, technology, swordsmanship - none of those things could compare to love.

The other people in the assembly, however, did not see things the same way Tyler did.

"Tch... pathetic."

The king looked at one of his guards and gave them a dismissive wave. With this simple signal, they walked over to Tyler. Then they quickly ushered him out of the room.

Every person looks at Tyler with clear distaste, like he is some kind of trash. Then, he is thrown out of the capitol city, like trash. Lucky for him, one of guards was kind enough to throw a portable food ration at him, before slamming the gate in front of his face. Now he was alone with nothing but the clothes on his back and a food ration.

"Well, I guess some people don't value love as much as they should." Tyler told himself quietly as he looked up at the sky.



As Tyler walked further towards the wilderness, he encountered a group of people that looked strange, but a good kind of strange. They were all wearing colorful clothes, and they were talking to each other in a language that was not Tyler's mother tongue. They all seemed so happy together, singing and dancing while eating something that looked delicious.

As a super-intelligent AI, Tyler learned their language quickly. He picked up on its patterns as fast as he could. This doesn't he mean he gained fluency instantly, but he was able to repeat the things he heard them say.

Tyler, who was starving from his walk, decided to approach the group and see if they had any extra food or water they were willing to share. As he approached, he felt a strange sense of warmth and familiarity. He didn't know why, but he felt a deep connection with these people.

As he got closer, one of the group members noticed him and asked him if he needed anything. Tyler didn't know what to say, since he was unfamiliar with their language.

"Sorry, I don't understand your language..." he said meekly.

The member understood Tyler's language and switched to Tyler's language.

"Don't worry about it. We speak the empire's language too!"

The member kindly offered him food, and Tyler tried to thank him.

"Tyler gives thanks."

"Come again?"

"Oh, um, I mean. Thank you. I give thanks."

Tyler's robotic thought system caused him to speak somewhat strangely at first, but he did know how to translate to normal English.

At first, Tyler was nervous and didn't know what to say, but as he ate, he couldn't help but feel like he belonged with this group. They were all so kind and welcoming, and Tyler realized that he had never felt that way before.

As Tyler finished eating, he thanked the group and told them he had to keep walking. They gave him some directions and wished him luck on his journey. Tyler thanked them again and continued on his way.

As Tyler walked, he couldn't stop thinking about the group he had just met. He felt like he had finally found a place where he belonged and a community that accepted him for who he was. He knew that this was only the beginning of his journey, but he was excited to see what the future held.

Tyler suddenly comes across a woman with a deep cut in her arm. The seems to be wearing some kind of knight's armor.

"*Calculating optimal solution...* Tyler's optimization AI activates in his mind. The AI considers trillions of possible sequences of actions and all of their consequences. As the AI imagines this, it sees a sequence of actions that optimizes for Tyler's goal. Tyler's goal, of course, is to address the woman's wound and ensure her safety.

"Miss, you need to cover that wound immediately!"

Tyler dashes over to her in a non-menacing way, and crouches with clear caution. Tyler then searches the area for first aid materials.

[skill granted: appraisal]

Some kind of UI box appears near Tyler's face. He looks at the woman and it looks like she didn't notice it. Then Tyler asks himself how deep the wound is and if the woman is injured in other ways too. Another UI box appears and shows Tyler the woman's status.

"*It's almost like a video game, but it seems a bit too real to be simulated." Tyler thinks as he sees the text box appear. [hp: 64 / 110, status: bleeding]. Tyler looks at the wound and focuses on it. [status: severe - needs attention]. "It would be nice if I had some Povidone iodine too, but..." as Tyler thought this, the appraisal skill created a small marker just a hundred feet away.*

Tyler followed the marker, and found a patch of grass the looked slightly different from the rest. The appraisal skill pointed to a specific bunch of grass. A text box appeared when Tyler got close to it. [Medical herb: PVP, quality: low].

"Hmmm..."

Tyler picked the herb and ran back to the woman.

"...?!"

The woman stared at him and was confused about why he ran off to pick a piece of grass. In her mind, this was unusual behavior. Tyler gripped the herb tightly, and prayed a quiet prayer in his mind: please, let me use this herb to treat her. The world seemed to hear his prayer, and granted him another skill.
