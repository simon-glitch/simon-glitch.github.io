###My new IGM 2020

IGM is lacking in many ways, and there are so many things that are just impossible or difficult to do in IGM as IGM is. Though, I have found a way around this (the eval effect), it is not the best. So, I will be programming a new IGM, called IGM 2020. This text is on what will be possible in IGM 2020.

So, the new features are:

《Properties》

Properties (stats) of things are now accessible by selectors. For example, you could get 1 things cost by saying `cost of thingKey`. "of" is used to select a thing's property, like `property of thing`.

All of a thing's stats/features are its properties, like the name, desc, cost, and [effects]. All properties of a thing will be stable when making the thing by saying `propertyName:data`. Property name can be a custom name or default name (like "desc"). Data can be some appropriate text to put there.

《New "=" behavior》

You will now be able to change any property of a thing using the set effect, like `set property of thingKey = data`. This is VERY powerful.

Using "=" on it's own will result in "=" as a condition. Conditions will simplify to values of 1 or 2 if not used in an if statement. If you want, you can put a condition in an expression like this: `number1*(number2=number3)%(10-(num4<num5)-(num4<num6))`. "<", ">", "<=, and ">=" work similarly, like in that statement.

《Custom effects》

Things can be given an effect property. If a thing's name is used at the front of some effect, or in some on effect property, its effect will be run. Here is an example:

```
*Thing1
  effect:
    toast This is a custom effect!
  end
*Thing2
  on click:
    Thing1
  end
```

You can make these effects really powerful by using inputs. Inputs are data you can feed into the effect when you use it (with parenthesis() ) that allow you to do more things.

《Custom scripting》

This allows you to add completely new stuff, but people should be encouraged to not use this unless they absolutely need to. There are exceptions though, and I will be adding a psuedo script that lets you sorta write javascript.

Though, to start, I will be adding an eval effect. This is in current IGM, but it requires /*special*/ conditions. The eval effect let's you run pure javascript, **be careful!**

《Quotes》

"Quotes" can be used to do more stuff in general. For example, quotes can be used in desc to embed script into it [instead of using brackets].
