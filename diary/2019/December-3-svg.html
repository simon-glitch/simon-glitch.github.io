How do I fix my iClever Bluetooth Keyboard which is compatible with Android, iPhone, Mac, Windows, and Linux? Read the description for the details on how my keyboard is malfunctioning.
I am pressing the keys on it and many of them are mapping to the wrong keys. The f1 through f12 and fn keys seem to work fine, and most of the letters work, but many keys and letters do not work properly. My problems are numberpad does nothing, numlock does nothing, 2 does nothing, b => b5, n => n6, g => g6, 1 => `, 3 => 5, 4 => 5, 5 => b5, down key does a single (extremely short) press when held. It was working fine until I swiped my finger acros the f1 through f12 keys (I might have been holding space, but I was NOT holding fn or control). I am using the keybaord on Adroid; I don't know what it does on other systems. Also, pressing left does page up (but pages up all the way).
