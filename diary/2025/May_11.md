Maybe I should write these diary entries more often.

I realized that people feel more compelled to write when they're emotional. Therefore, a lot of the world's writing, including a lot of the influential writing, is emotionally motivated. Also, most diary entries should therefore be emotionally motivated, right? Yes, of course. This truth seems to be ignored / not realized enough. Well, whatever. Well actually I think I could probably write many essays on how emotions influenced various writings.

Of course, I'd like you to know that I think emotions are very important and that emotional thinking is very important.

I had lots of fun explaining to Elly at church today (Country Gospel in Dowling) that there are 4 types of thinking and they're all perfectly valid in their own rights. Those types are logical, emotional, social, and subconscious. Letting your emotions influence your writing is perfectly fine. But you should probably state and explain where and how they are being used, since there is a good chance it is not so clear to other people.

Also, it is apparently Mother's day today. Apparently other people care about that a lot. Well, being a mother is obviously very important, but it's not so relevant to my personal life at the moment.

I feel like I spent the last month just trying to survive. I should probably calm down right now. I am intentionally trying to feel sad and stressed. It is fun in its own right. I'm aiming more for sad then stressed right now. Now I just feel tired though. Sleeping while under an emotion is fun, right? I dunno really. It should be though.

But yeah, all my procrastination has left me feeling half-dead. I definitely failed one of my classes this semester, just like last spring. And now my grandpa and everyone is telling me to get a job. I can't do that! I'm half-dead right now. I haven't told anyone that, since I was afraid people would tell me not to procrastinate so much. Now I just feel tired. I guess I'll tell my grandpa about it. I sure won't tell me dad.

My dad has me feeling pretty stressed all on his own. But I have to get over that. Even he is unintentionally telling me I should get over him and not let him stress me. He says he doesn't want me to take his insults to heart or care about his feelings. I just need to leave him alone. Poor old man. He'll hit me if I don't shut the fuck up. Specifically the fuck up by the way. What's the difference to just shutting up. Who fucking knows. My dad says "the fuck" does not indicate that he is angry or upset or any similar feeling. He just uses it for no reason apparently.

I'm not stupid, dude. He needs to stop trying to deceive me into thinking his word choice is not indicative of his feelings. Ever since I was a young kid, I've known that people's word choice and emphasis is heavily influenced by their emotions, and that the synonyms people use are typically chosen using a lot of decision making by the speaker. It's just true. Usually a lot of decisions go into what we say. And the more emotional we are, the more likely we are to use emotional decisions to determine what we say, and the larger the number of emotional decisions there will be behind our words. That is just how we function.

Yes, I'm writing about that. May as well. I find it to be quite interesting. And of course it's an interesting fact that I use every day. Emotions are very important after all.

Gosh, my dad really is trying to lie to me a lot. And he says he doesn't lie. Why? Because he doesn't want to? Because there are certain types of lies he finds unacceptible? Are most of his lies completely unintentional. That's probably it. It's pretty normal for someone to want to hide their feelings and their emotional issues by covering up everything they say with lies. Well, that statement has some exaggerations, but it conveys the point: we all tend to hide our feelings and related things with lies. I'm not so sure about my dad, but I think he's doing that a bit here and there. And the times when he does do it are noticeable. Because I'm trying to talk about how he makes me feel, and he has his own feelings on the matter, so he tries to hide those, and it comes off as disrespectful, since he doesn't really care about my feelings. That's fine though, right? Come on. I'm responsible for thinking about my own feelings, not just dealing with them. If I want to talk about them, I should find someone else to talk to.

My eyes are getting a bit tired. Potentially from staying up late at night watching a dude play Factorio. Yes, I think that's why. Okay.

Anyways, I sure do love talking about these really general facts and how they play into my life. Especially since -- as you can hopefully tell -- they are having some stressful side effects on me. You know, it looks like I was kind of stressed to write that paragraph above, since there are a lot of apostrophes. Hm. Insteresting, right? I'm just feeling so contemplative and philosophical today. "philosophical" is definitely the wrong word. Does English have a word for this? Hmmmm. Welp, I'll look into it. English is very lacking in words for feelings. *amused grin*; Maybe even bemused! Whatever that means. Maybe it's useful, Simon.

Ah, another goal of these diary entries is to write down my thoughts. It's a lot better than trying to offer it to a specific person in the context of like a direct message or an essay or something. Yes. It really is better to put these things in **their own** place. For a general audience.

Ooh, by the way. This isn't my first time noting this. I'm not sure how often I note though. Anyways. A lot of my writing style is based on Hidamarisou Translations (https://hidamarisoutranslations.com/author/hidamarisou/). Hidamarisou translates various Japanese webnovels, and he is super good at it. He might also have some amazing art skills, but I'm not sure. One of the novels he translates has an accompanying manga with Hidamarisou listed as the artist, I think. It is "My Twin Sister Was Taken as a Miko and I Was Thrown Away but I'm Probably the Miko". Them Japanese webnovels have the best titles, right? At least it explains what the Miko is. Well that's like one of the main focuses of the plot.

You know what's funny? I'm using some of the techniques I learned from my English class to make the diary entry a little easier to read. Okay, I'm a bit skeptical of that. I kind of already knew this technique of splitting my paragraphs up to be a little more coherent. And of using short sentences sometimes. But I think having it emphasized in class is making me realize to a far great degree how important (or useful) it is. Also, aftering writing some essays and hearing so much writing advice and reading some particularly **bad** writing in class, I've really realized how important it is to explain things. And I've refined my understanding and technique on how things need to be explained in order to make sense. And of course, right now, I'm doing what I can to make all of this understandable by explaining things. Explanation is so important! Arguing with my dad so much has also actually helped me realize the importance. Yeah. Finally of course, we can thank Hidamarisou Translations as well as the other web novels I've read for teaching me quite a few things.
