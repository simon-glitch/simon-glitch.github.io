# My new self
A few months ago (around December) I asked my subconscious to start a new project that aimed to incorporate my 'old self' as a part of my new self. It finally finished about 2 days ago. Apparently it doesn't matter how much sleep I get.

Thinking about it now, 8:08 AM, waiting for my grandpa to cook some pancakes, it seems I need to some kind of extra 'startup' step to initialize the old self.

The old self, while I'll call origin, really does feel like a kid. I wanted my subconscious to implement the self from when I was a baby, but apparently it is entangled with whatever version of myself that I used when I was in 7th grade. I guess I was using the origin at that time so I could build a new version of myself and gain understanding faster. Interesting. That really opens me up to a whole new perspective on the whole matter.

The origin seems to have temper issues, but that's nothing the rest of me can't handle, and it feels quite genuine to actually be angry about things for once. It's like I haven't been very angry in so many years.

## Part 2
So, I'm suspicious that origin is the self I had when I was an infant, and that it created my child self all on its own. After the child self was created, origin went inert. Origin was reinstantiated during my time in 7th and 8th grade, and fused with part of my developing self at the time. Origin created my new self, tore my child self into pieces and created new selves from it. Origin also changed my priorities from "being an impressive scientist" and "doing the things that interest me" to "improving my understanding of things that interest me", and added people to the list of "things that interest me". This tearing process removed the child self and involved reworking its parts into an improved new self. Once the new self was properly instantiated, origin went inert again.

Due to origin being incredibly useful, I've decided to incorporate it into the current setup, which is basically the same setup origin designed a little over 7 years ago. Origin's abilities far surpass anything I've ever seen. It's so creative and can solve problems so quickly.

# My ornery dad
Anyways, my dad's orneriness is just unbearable now. He gets so upset over me asking him just about anything. Joke: I'm almost surprised he doesn't get upset when I answer his yes/no questions. He complains when I smirk or smile at him and claims that I'm happy about him being angry. Yeah right! As if I'd ever enjoy him being angry. Who in the world would enjoy being threatened and told that they're face is going to be slammed into the counter? Not me! Probably not you either, at least if you're mentally well.

My dad also insults me over everything. But I won't and don't take his insults seriously. My grandpa says it's because my dad is not feeling so great about himself. I don't want to sound judgemental though. My grandpa seems to talk in ways that sound judgemental, despite him not being too judgemental himself. But nonetheless it is very true. People who are feeling down and having trouble in their lives tend to lash out at others, due to their feelings of shame, fear, or disappointment. Afterall, a mouse bites back when it's cornered. So if someone feels too much pressure or stress in their life, they will act rude and disrespectful. Some people might even intentionally try to be rude in order to get attention or see their suffering be reflected in others. I must note 2 very important things though:
* It's very hard to tell what someone else's problems are.
* It's very hard to tell how exactly the person's problems are affecting their behavior.
* It's especially hard to figure out what they think about their problems and what their actual intentions are.
* They should not be judged for lashing out.

If anything, when someone lashes out at you and you don't really see why they're doing it, you should try to help them with whatever emotional problem they are probably dealing with. A lot of people our there really need a lot of help. It's your responsibility as a human to do what you can to help. But don't feel pressured to go out of your way. Be proactive and decide for yourself when you have the time and energy to help others. Or if you're religious like me, look for a religious reason or incentive to lead your decisions on when to help others.
