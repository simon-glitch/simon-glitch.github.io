## About June 5
On Tuesday, my dad got so mad at me because I couldn't chop up some bread for him. And he was calling me stupid, and I didn't like that. So I stood up for myself and called him stupid back. It really is stupid that he doesn't understand how hard it is for me to do things, and the fact that I just suck at physical things. He ought to consider my perspective, and maybe even validate my feelings. Not insult me and try to make me feel ashamed of myself for being bad at things. And I know from an earlier conversation that he really does want me ot be ashamed and that he really does want me to feel insulted. Which is just too cruel. He is too cruel.

I wrote about this in a Google Doc the other day, but at my grandpa's place right now. I ought to put a copy of that document here in this diary.

Anyways, my dad didn't like me standing up for myself. He never does. But I'm going to stand up for myself more from now on. I don't want him undermining me. Besides! Between the 2 of us, I'm the only one who makes any money, and I'm the only one who's open-minded. Though I shouldn't put too much thought into thinking I'm better than him, since I should respect him.

But hey! If he's going to insult me, I'm going to remind myself that I'm better than him, at least a few times!

Well, after I stood up for myself, he tried to kick me out of the house. I made sure to tell him that I live there and that he can't kick me out of my own house. But he didn't like that, so he tried to threaten me and say that he'll make my day hell if I stay there. Such a jerk! I decided to show him some respect though, and sneak into the garage. Later, I came back in from the garage, and he never even noticed I was gone. I was actually very worried he'd find out, since I know that finding out would make him feel betrayed, because he is such a selfish jerk. Anyways, I obviously don't want to him find out. If you're reading this, please don't tell him. I don't want him yelling at me any more than he already is. But I refuse to let him kick me out of my own house. I should be the one making him go into the garage.

My dad also didn't like when he charged at me and I pushed him away. And he complained that I was assaulting him. Yeah right! He's always the aggressive one. He's the one who gets up out of his seat, chases me into my room, gets in my face, and threatens me. And he's the one who says he wants to control me by threatening me, and that his hands will supposedly speak better than him. I have all the reason in the world to shove him away and try to defend myself. Heck, there probably isn't enough reasno in this world to match the sheer justification I have to shove him away from me.

## Today
Today, I'm hanging out with my grandpa, and telling him how much my dad sucks! Agh. I feel so angry, and afraid and anxious too. At least I can handle it just fine. I'm pretty sure my feelings have absolutely nothing to do with my dad though. The only thing I feel about him is that his behavior is ridiculous. For a lot of reasons, but it's not important enough to write many of those down here.

One big down side of having no internet, is I can't contribute to the Minecraft wiki. Errr. Maybe I should have copy-pasted the source code from Potion and a bunch of related pages so I could work on it here. So many of the wiki's pages are kind of messy, especially intro paragraphs. The tables on the wiki are the most used and appreciated features, at least by YouTubers and people who are familiar with the game.

Also, also, I really love Media Wiki formatting. Like [[links]], ''italics'', and '''bold''' text. Templates are really fun too.
