3:37 AM
The sunburn is so bad now that I can't sleep. The feeling of it on my back some too much to sleep. Every movement hurts. My shoulders have these big bubbly blisters. I guess I'll have to stay awake for the test of the night.

I could try going into the house and applying some vinegar or more of that lotion stuff, but I think my skin is getting pretty class to being ready to peel. It should hurt a little less then. Unfortunately, the skin on my left leg won't do that, and it actually hurts quite a bit. However, if it won't peel, then that also means it won't take as long. Do it will probably be feeling better some time today.

I could try to half sleep. Yeah, I'll try that. I'm pretty good at eeking those dreams out of my subconscious. It's not full sleep, but it does rest me a little at least.

6:33 AM
I tried to test for about an hour and a maybe a few minutes, but I was in too much pain, so I decided to play Minesweeper Collector.

6:36 AM
I just checked my shoulders, and it really does look like the blisters are almost ready to peel off. Also, all the ulcers I'm getting from the stress from this pain are the worst man. Why do ulcers even exist. They seem like they would just cause more stress. Note to self: of someone is significantly stressed, do everything you can to rapidly decrease stress, before they get sick in a cycle.

I'm done right now though. But hopefully you get the idea: my skin hurts a lot.

6:41 AM
Time to go in the house.

2:34 PM
# Stress laughing
I just realized that being stressed makes me laugh, naturally. As a reaction to reduce / for with the stress. In particular, it is caused by me thinking about just how stressful the situation is.

My dad always asks my why I'm laughing at him. And now I know why. He genuinely thinks that I think it is funny when he is mad at me. Why would he ever think that? Why would I laugh at him? Especially when he doesn't even do anything worth laughing at. Weird!

And you know what I realized the other day (about a week ago)? I realized that my dad doesn't like the existence of my perspective. It's not me having the perspective it imposing it on him. It's the me existence of it!

# Hard worker
And you know what I realized yesterday? My dad thinks that I don't even try! He thinks I just give up on things when they are too hard. But lots of people say I'm a hard worker, and actually it is the one compliment I get the most. So it can't possibly be a lie. There is no way that everyone is lying about that same thing, especially when I don't even prompt them, and don't even ask them to talk to me about it. They just like say it kind of at random.

So it must be not only true, but annually clear, and prominent enough that is is one take they remember without even thinking about it. Gosh, I must be a really hard worker. My dad thinks I'm a quitter. Well it seems I'm the one person who will try three hardest before quitting.

Gosh, how could my dad be so wrong??? Like he says I'm the exact opposite of what I am the most. Will he calls me should too. And he also insults My programming projects, because he doesn't remember them, but I've literally shown them to him many times. I am genuinely disappointed by how little programming I've done, but the only thing to blame the is that I procrastinate. And maybe some other things too. But I actually have no idea what those other things might be.

# A liar
My dad is such a liar. First. He says he doesn't insult me, but he also says he wants me to feel insulted. Second. He says that he never calls me stupid, but he does all the time. I understand his definitions of "insult" and "stupid" and "lie" are different for no reason, but even by his definitions, he is a liar. And, I have an idea as to why he is a liar too.

First, let's look at the evidence. My dad says every conversation is a manipulation. He also says that he plans out conversations before he has them. And I know he plans or conversations with me. He has always liked talking down to me and scolding me, and he likes to plan it out so he can make it hurt more. Which, I actually found incredibly insulting and disrespectful as a child. Because he basically planned it out like a battle. And his girlfriend would help him too.

Please, I beg you, never do that to your children. It is traumatizing, and makes the person feel like their opinion doesn't even matter. It is just a whole other level of disrespect. And especially don't do it while having your partner support you. Teaming up on a child is straight up verbal abuse.

And every conversation being a manipulation? Yeah. It's a stupid lie my dad learned in prison. Don't believe it. In fact, most conversations aren't manipulations, and you should make sure that the ones that are manipulations never happen to ne begin with.

But yeah, my dad always beats around the bush and asks indirect questions. This is to hide his actual goal. Of course, it had literally never worked on me. Even when I was a little kid and didn't understand my own emotions, it was always really clear to me that my dad was beating around the bush, and it was usually obvious what he was talking about. And I would just find it annoying, because I thought he wanted to make it some kind of sick surprise in order to hurt my feelings, because that itsomething bullies do. And I hate bullying. Just the thought of it repulses me. And I've never even really been buliied. Anyways manipulation and bullying are pretty similar, so I guess young Simon was pretty right about my dad being untrustworthy. I should have trusted young Simon. Now that I think about it, he was right about a lot of things  He was only missing like 1 or 2 things. This really changes my perspective.

# Ulcers
I should clarify that ulcers are these minor pains that I feel when I'm stressed. And pain causes stress, so pain causes ulcers which cause now pain. Thankfully, it is not enough to stress me out, especially since thinking about it makes me laugh.

# A fibber
Now my dad says he plans every conversation, but I know he doesn't do all of the ones he has with me, and he doesn't do them sorry well. It's super easy for me to get him sidetracked.

4:23 PM
# FYI
I got sunburn on Friday (August 8).

# Improving condition
It was its worst early this morning. It's been getting better throughout the day. I've had more blisters forming (on my shoulders, especially the sides of my shoulders) throughout the day, and in the last few hours, they've been oozing. They're like zits that pop themselves! Also, all of the ones on the left are gone. I peeled some of the skin though, so now there is this raw spot that keeps leaking. It's literally leaking as I write this. It might we sweat. I hope it's whatever toxins that are left from the sunburn. Probably the latter. It's probably coming out of the one opening it has. My right shoulder though... I think I might need to give it some manual attention. But that would hurt a lot. Also, on second though, the raw spot could be leaking a mix of sweat and pus. I think it's mostly pus though, since I'm sitting in front of the fan and I'm all cooled down now. Maybe the pus is coming out through a sweat glands to begin though... in that case I should try to be in the warmest place possible. At least (hypothetically) if I want to make the blisters well more and release more pus. Though (in actuality) I don't want to do that.

What's really good news is my skin has calmed down significantly, overall. So I'll be able to actually get some sleep tonight. Considering I got like 5 hours last night, I'm feeling like I wanna go to bed now. And it's only 4:32!

# Back to my dad being a fibber
So, I think my dad fibs about the following things:
* That every conversation is a manipulation
    * I just don't think that idea is properly reflected by his actual behaviors.
    * Actually, he defines a manipulation as "an action causing change". All actions cause change, therefore all conceivable actions, just by the nature of our universe, cause change. This definition is a **useless definition**, since the word redundantly has the exact same meaning as action. It also makes the saying useless, since obviously, having a conversation is a type of action. Also, no one else defines manipulation this way.
* That he plans out his conversations
    * He does plan them, but his planning is not thorough nor comprehensive, and his execution is sloppy. I can easily throw him curve balls, or distract him (those are two separate things I can do, which correspond with the two critiques about his planning that I listed).
* He doesn't lie
    * Translation: I'm saying that my dad does lie. The following bullet points elaborate on how he does.
    * In his defense, he is forgetful. And he does also try to manipulate, and beat around the bush a lot. I would consider these to be other forms of deception, and thus different than lying.
    * He also likes saying "true" statements that are misleading or give an incompletely picture of the truth. He actually says that when other people use "true" statements like that, that action is a form of lying. However, my dad does not apply this logic to his own statements. This is because he is a hypocrite, and because his perspective makes it very hard for him to see this. If I bring this up with him, I'm pretty sure he'll use his perspective to prove to himself that he's not a hypocrite.

My dad's perspective is wrong on these matters:
* That he doesn't see why other people aren't good at things.
    * Also, he doesn't want to know why, since knowing why would actually oppose his perspective.
* That I'm a quitter.
    * It's just blatantly wrong and he has no reason to believe so.
* That I'm not normal. Or that I'm worse at things that other people.
    * I am neurodivergent, but my dad's perspective does not accont for this.
        * What's funny, is my dad is neurodivergent too.

My dad's bad definitions for things:
* Lying: Saying a statement that happens to be false. By this logic, saying "there are 100,000 miles of blood vessels in the human body" would count as lying.
    * A better definiton would be: Saying a statement you believe to be false, and saying it in a way that implies that you believe it is true, in order to persuade the listener that it is true. This definition excludes multiple types of statements:
        * Statement you believe are true, but are actually false.
        * Sarcastic statements.
        * Example statements or statements that are not genuinely being asserted.
        * Statements made while not sober or mentally competent.
        * Saying statements without really understanding their consequences.
* Manipulation: Perfect synonym for action.
    * A better definiton would be: Some form of deception. Not all actions are deceptive.
* Stupid: Anything that makes my dad, specifically, angry.
    * He has never actually said this. This is just the effective definition he uses.
* Angry: Perfect synonym for engraged.
* Frustrated: Some variant of angry. "Angry" here refers to the normal definition of angry, which is the one I use.
* Irritated, or any other synonym for angry: I have no clue. He has his own weird definitions and none of them make any sense to me. He also gets really mad if you try to ask him, so I'll never have any clue what the exact definitions are. Also also, I don't know where he got his definitions from. I'm guessing from his rough childhood. I don't see the logic for having such specific words for anger though. I guess my dad has been struggling with it all his life and therefore made terminology for it. I avoid anger at all costs, so I don't get it.

# The betrayal
You know, a while back, my dad told me he wants me to feel insulted by his insults. And I just feel so betrayed over that. His insults are so mean, and if I took them seriously, I would be in really bad state emotionally. I would be so stressed out, and would hate myself, and feel absolutely worthless. And the fact he's been insulting me all my life would just leave me feeling like I'm hated and like I never deserved to live to begin with. And um, welp. You see, I know all of that is total nonsense. I ain't gonna let his insults drag me down like that. And with the sheer number of them that he's dishes out, and with how **unjustified** I now realize they are, there is no way I'm gonna ever take them seriously. No way.

Besides, I can't let him drag me down. I can't let anyone make me feel worthless. Because I know how valuable and precious and beautiful and amazing I am. If you don't see it, that's fine. But I know that I shine brighter than all the stars in the sky. Except the sun. It's pretty bright. But on a good day, I can even outshine the sun!~ And I don't want anyone to hurt me emotionally. And if that's all they're trying to do with their words, then why should I listen to them? Well obviously, I shouldn't, and thus the answer is NOPE. I don't like pain nor sadness. I like joy. It's my duty to stay positive. Genuinely positive. It's my duty to try to wear a smile, for my own good. Just to keep my heart feeling good. Just to keep my soul at ease.

And don't you go and say that I force myself not to feel certain emotions. Frankly, which emotions I let myself feel and then I feel them is my business and my responsibility. Also, I explore my emotions all the time. Of course, as an engineer, I see my emotions as tools. But as an artist, I also see the depth of their beauty. Really, I think all tools should be created in order to further the goal of beautifying the world and realizing the beauty of life. *Sigh.*

Gosh, Simon. You really feel like writing right now, don't you?
* Well, I have literally nothing else to do. Or little else. I read through a lot of the chapters of webnovels I downloaded on my phone, and we have no wifi here.
Us having no wifi here is a **really** good thing. You really waste too much time on YouTube and other places.
* I know, I know.
We really need to clean our act up though, dude. *Exasperated and disappointed sigh.* We both know many problems our bad habits are causing us.
* Dude, that's such a good song.
Yeah, it is. Maybe we shouldn't be talking to ourself?
* Bro, what do you mean? Come on. You know how introverted we are. *Smiles proudly.*
Well, whatever. It's not a bad thing. At least I keep my sanity this way. Yes, yes, I know. You're thinking "this guy is clearly crazy". Trust me, if I lost my sanity, it would be much worse than this.
* They don't need to trust you. Or at least in my opinion, they shouldn't need to. Like, it's kinda obvious what it would be like if you lost your sanity. Like, you know, that would mean you wouldn't be able to think straight, you wouldn't think about normal things, like how to design good video games.
Yes, exactly. Video game design is a very normal thing to think about. Normal as in, not insane. No further explanation of the obvious should be needed.
* Hold up. We're not explaining the obvious. We're using clarifications to select a distinction on which definition of "insane" we're referring to here. And as we both know, we are crazy. But we're not insane.
Did you get that, chat? I hope you did. 🙃💙
