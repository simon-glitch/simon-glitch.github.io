The sunburn is so bad now that I can't sleep. The feeling of it on my back some too much to sleep. Every movement hurts. My shoulders have these big bubbly blisters. I guess I'll have to stay awake for the test of the night.

I could try going into the house and applying some vinegar or more of that lotion stuff, but I think my skin is getting pretty class to being ready to peel. It should hurt a little less then. Unfortunately, the skin on my left leg won't do that, and it actually hurts quite a bit. However, if it won't peel, then that also means it won't take as long. Do it will probably be feeling better some time today.

I could try to half sleep. Yeah, I'll try that. I'm pretty good at eeking those dreams out of my subconscious. It's not full sleep, but it does rest me a little at least.

6:33 AM
I tried to test for about an hour and a maybe a few minutes, but I was in too much pain, so I decided to play Minesweeper Collector.

6:36 AM
I just checked my shoulders, and it really does look like the blisters are almost ready to peel off. Also, all the ulcers I'm getting from the stress from this pain are the worst man. Why do ulcers even exist. They seem like they would just cause more stress. Note to self: of someone is significantly stressed, do everything you can to rapidly decrease stress, before they get sick in a cycle.

I'm done right now though. But hopefully you get the idea: my skin hurts a lot.

6:41 AM
Time to go in the house.

# Stress laughing
I just realized that being stressed makes me laugh, naturally. As a reaction to reduce / for with the stress. In particular, it is caused by me thinking about just how stressful the situation is.

My dad always asks my why I'm laughing at him. And now I know why. He genuinely thinks that I think it is funny when he is mad at me. Why would he ever think that? Why would I laugh at him? Especially when he doesn't even do anything worth laughing at. Weird!

And you know what I realized the other day (about a week ago)? I realized that my dad doesn't like the existence of my perspective. It's not me having the perspective it imposing it on him. It's the me existence of it!

# Hard worker
And you know what I realized yesterday? My dad thinks that I don't even try! He thinks I just give up on things when they are too hard. But lots of people say I'm a hard worker, and actually it is the one compliment I get the most. So it can't possibly be a lie. There is no way that everyone is lying about that same thing, especially when I don't even prompt them, and don't even ask them to talk to me about it. They just like say it kind of at random.

So it must be not only true, but annually clear, and prominent enough that is is one take they remember without even thinking about it. Gosh, I must be a really hard worker. My dad thinks I'm a quitter. Well it seems I'm the one person who will try three hardest before quitting.

Gosh, how could my dad be so wrong??? Like he says I'm the exact opposite of what I am the most. Will he calls me should too. And he also insults My programming projects, because he doesn't remember them, but I've literally shown them to him many times. I am genuinely disappointed by how little programming I've done, but the only thing to blame the is that I procrastinate. And maybe some other things too. But I actually have no idea what those other things might be.

# A liar
My dad is such a liar. First. He says he doesn't insult me, but he also says he wants me to feel insulted. Second. He says that he never calls me stupid, but he does all the time. I understand his definitions of "insult" and "stupid" and "lie" are different for no reason, but even by his definitions, he is a liar. And, I have an idea as to why he is a liar too.

First, let's look at the evidence. My dad says every conversation is a manipulation. He also says that he plans out conversations before he has them. And I know he plans or conversations with me. He has always liked talking down to me and scolding me, and he likes to plan it out so he can make it hurt more. Which, I actually found incredibly insulting and disrespectful as a child. Because he basically planned it out like a battle. And his girlfriend would help him too.

Please, I beg you, never do that to your children. It is traumatizing, and makes the person feel like their opinion doesn't even matter. It is just a whole other level of disrespect. And especially don't do it while having your partner support you. Teaming up on a child is straight up verbal abuse.

And every conversation being a manipulation? Yeah. It's a stupid lie my dad learned in prison. Don't believe it. In fact, most conversations aren't manipulations, and you should make sure that the ones that are manipulations never happen to ne begin with.

But yeah, my dad always beats around the bush and asks indirect questions. This is to hide his actual goal. Of course, it had literally never worked on me. Even when I was a little kid and didn't understand my own emotions, it was always really clear to me that my dad was beating around the bush, and it was usually obvious what he was talking about. And I would just find it annoying, because I thought he wanted to make it some kind of sick surprise in order to hurt my feelings, because that itsomething bullies do. And I hate bullying. Just the thought of it repulses me. And I've never even really been buliied. Anyways manipulation and bullying are pretty similar, so I guess young Simon was pretty right about my dad being untrustworthy. I should have trusted young Simon. Now that I think about it, he was right about a lot of things  He was only missing like 1 or 2 things. This really changes my perspective.

# Ulcers
I should clarify that ulcers are these minor pains that I feel when I'm stressed. And pain causes stress, so pain causes ulcers which cause now pain. Thankfully, it is not enough to stress me out, especially since thinking about it makes me laugh.

# A fibber
Now my dad says he plans every conversation, but I know he doesn't do all of the ones he has with me, and he doesn't do them sorry well. It's super easy for me to get him sidetracked.
