4:12 PM
So, on Saturday, Jim's friend, Steve, told me to read this book called Cain's Jawbone. Well, he left me his copy of it at Jim's place today at 10:00 AM. He also gave us some bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit sandwiches from McDonald's. Though he didn't actually stay to chat.

Anyways, he says this book, Cain's Jawdone is supposed to be a super hard puzzle. I forgot to take it with me when I left Jim's place. But look at a few pages, and honestly, it looks like an easy task to me. Many of the sentences start with "I" or refer to the 1st person near the beginning, which definitely helps make the puzzle harder. But it looked like mostly normal English. For some reason, the book itself says its a hard puzzle right on the front. Yeah right. I'll show the publishers how wrong they are.

# Sleep
4:16
Anyways, I just feel like writing because I'm bored.

Last night I actually got plenty of sleep. I went to bed at 8:00 PM, and then didn't wake up until around 1:30 AM. Then I slept on my belly until about 4:00 AM. That gave the skin on my back some time to heal. Then I slept on my back until like 6:40 AM. That was probably around 10 to 10.5 hours of sleep.

For reference, here is how much sleep I've been getting in last few days:
* Format: Day it was when I started sleeping for the night: Hours of sleep.
* Tuesday: 9
* Wednesday: 5
* Thursday: 5
* Friday: 8
* Saturday: 5
* Sunday: 10.5
* Average: 7.08

Why no sleep Wednesday and Thursday? Well, I get distracted on websites easily, duh.

# Misc
You know, every time I get a "chill" on my back, it feels extra chilly, due to my sunburn. And I actually get a lot of chills. And the sunburn makes me feel vulnerable, which makes me get even more chills.

4:24 PM
Wow, it really is windy right now.

4:25 PM
Anyways, I think many people write when they are either bored or emotional.

# Evidence
Suspicious things about my dad:
* He calls me a quitter -> He's a quitter.
    * He tries very hard to hide this.
* He's always trying to imidate me -> He feels intimiated.
    * Potentially by me? My perspective intimidates him, because it contrasts with his.
    * He tries very hard to hide this.
* He doesn't want to be a liar.
    * And doesn't want me to lie to him.
    * -> Trust issues?
* He doesn't want to get married, because he can't dedicate himself to a woman.
    * -> He has a free spirit.
    * Probably also trust issues.
* He brags about himself a lot -> He's not confident in himself.
    * I'm confident in myself, and I only brag when prompted. Or when I need to amp myself up.
* He doesn't want therapist or anything similar, because he already knows about psychology and understands himself.
    * He is wrong there, but that's beside the point.
    * -> His given reason is a sign that he is sick and needs healed.
    * If he didn't need healed, he would say that directly or something similar.
    * Or he would describe the alternative method of healing. i.e. "prayer", "meditation", "companionship", etc.
* He doesn't want to talk about feelings. In fact, he's repulsed by the idea of anyone talking about their feelings. He thinks people should just deal with them.
    * -> Lack of emotional understanding.
    * It's fun to talk about emotions in an abstract or hypothetical context, just like it is with any other topic. And talking about your emotions helps you get a second perspective and more ideas on how to deal with them. Dealing with them is still your responsibility, but other people can be helpful and provide ideas and emotional support.
    * This trait could potentially be related to the other conclusions, but I won't include it, since "Lack of emotional understanding" is a very different problem.

And my dad has always exhibited these suspicious traits.

# Conclusion
So, he doesn't have the courage or tenacity he wishes he has, and he feels like he can't trust anyone. But why? Why doesn't he believe in himself? And why doesn't he believe anyone can help him? And he knows he's sick. But he believes it can't be cured. But why?

Clearly, he has let doubt get to his head. Clearly he is in dispair and has been for a while now. And he really doesn't want anyone to know. Maybe that's part of the reason why he doesn't like how I always try to get to the bottom of things. Well, I do also get annoying.

But why does my dad doubt himself? I know for a fact that he has the same natural tenacity and positive energy I do it. But there is doubt holding him back. And for some reason, he's learned to shut down any attempt at talking about the subject or helping him. How annying. I could probably help him if he let me. I don't know how to give therapy, but I do understand my own feelings at least.

And my dad ought to know that him not wanting help is an objectively bad thing. The harder one part of his mind tells him to avoid getting help, the harder the smart part of his mind should urge himself to get it. That's the strategy. Is to see the desire to solve the problem on your own as a bad thing. To see getting help as objectively good, and avoiding help as objectively bad. "Objectively" meaning "without room for argument". Of course, objectivity contrasts with doubt, and objective good contrasts with doubt greatly.

# Cause
5:10 PM
So why? How did it get like this?

Well, my theory is that he literally got it beaten out of him when he was young. He went through some tough shit as a kid. And I guess he never thought to heal from that. Though I doubt the old memories are causing a problem now. The problem now is that he's simply learned to doubt himself and learned to not ask for help. There could also be some more recent memories that have replace the effective occupations of the old memories. Not actually replaced, since the old memories are still there, but the new memories are probably causing most of the negative effects on his spirit.

So in conclusion, it's trauma. Just like what I've suffered with before.

I should see if I can actually get my dad some help. Maybe I can try to force it on him.

# Sunburn
5:18 PM
My sunburn pain is mostly gone now. I think I still won't be able to sleep on my side ðŸ˜­

But at least I'll be able to sleep on my back and probably not have to switch sides. It should be much easier tonight. Heck, maybe I could take a snooze right now. But it's not really necessary. I've gotten like 7 hours of sleep on average the last 6 days though, so I'm feeling okay right now. I know my brain is not the same as a battery, but hey, I'm mostly functional. Definitely ready to tap out though ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜³

# Self-deprecating
I really like to make a lot of self-deprecating jokes and statements. Whenever I talk to AI, it points them out, and calls me confident and humble. Geez, AI, no one asked. I know how amazing I am. I don't need reminded. Well, it usually assumes I'm not confident. So it usually gets it the wrong way around. Dumb AI. Clearly a sign that it lacks basic emotional intelligence.

Self-deprecating jokes are a sign of self-understanding by the way. And making them easily without thinking about it and using positive wording like I do is a sign of confidence.

# Phone calls
5:24 PM
Oh, earlier, at like 3:~~ PM (three something PM), my grandpa's friend Ed called while my grandpa was mowing the lawn. That's like the second time someone has happened to call my grandpa while he's mowing the lawn, and I'm chilling here on the carpet ðŸ˜„ (yes I find that funny). Also, Ed was kind of lucky, since I decided to go to the other room a few minutes later. The other room is a separate building where there is a bedroom, bathroom, and the garage. It's actually not a valid bedroom because it's not suspended above the garage. If it was suspended, my grandpa's place would be 2 bed, 2 bath.

# School
5:31 PM
People keep asking me about school because my grandpa tells them all I'm in college. I'm
