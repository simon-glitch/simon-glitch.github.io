So, on Saturday, Jim's friend, Steve, told me to read this book called Cain's Jawbone. Well, he left me his copy of it at Jim's place today at 10:00 AM. He also gave us some bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit sandwiches from McDonald's. Though he didn't actually stay to chat.

Anyways, he says this book, Cain's Jawdone is supposed to be a super hard puzzle. I forgot to take it with me when I left Jim's place. But look at a few pages, and honestly, it looks like an easy task to me. Many of the sentences start with "I" or refer to the 1st person near the beginning, which definitely helps make the puzzle harder. But it looked like mostly normal English. For some reason, the book itself says its a hard puzzle right on the front. Yeah right. I'll show the publishers how wrong they are.

Anyways, I just feel like writing because I'm bored.

Last night I actually got plenty of sleep. I went to bed at 8:00 PM, and then didn't wake up until around 1:30 AM. Then I slept on my belly until about 4:00 AM. That gave the skin on my back some time to heal. Then I slept on my back until like 6:40 AM. That was probably around 10 to 10.5 hours of sleep.

For reference, here is how much sleep I've been getting in last few days:
* Format: Day it was when I started sleeping for the night: Hours of sleep.
* Wednesday: 5
* Thursday: 5
* Friday: 8
* Saturday: 5
* Sunday: 10.5

Why no sleep Wednesday and Thursday? Well, I get distracted on websites easily, duh.

You know, every time I get a "chill" on my back, it feels extra chilly, due to my sunburn. And I actually get a lot of chills. And the sunburn makes me feel vulnerable, which makes me get even more chills.

Wow, it really is windy right now.

Anyways, I think many people write when they are either bored or emotional.
