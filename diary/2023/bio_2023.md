I am good at just about anything I put my mind to. I do make mistakes, and I am not as reliable as the average person. When I do work, I either fail or succeed, and it seems really random at times. When I do succeed, I perform about 4 times as well as the average person, so my mean performance ends up exceeding my peers and coworkers.

Some people call me a hard worker, which is mostly true. I usually make a great effort to do everything a perfectly as possible, and I don't give up easily. However, at times, I do slow down, and I do slack off, because I can't work at 400% all the time. Usually, I pick good times to slow down, so my mean performance is usually a lot better than you would expect it to be. I am also a fast learner, and ask a lot of questions, but you might not have the patience for all my questions.

I was really careful writing this, because I don't want to be too dishonest. Sometimes, I act immature, because resisting my instincts every second of the day is difficult, and I have a lot of energy that is just hard to contain. However, I seem to do a good enough job at reserving all of my immature behavior and inappopriate thoughts for when I am at home, because almost no one has ever noticed them.
