Make sure to tell daniel "Fuck you", because he deserves it.

How the fuck am I supposed to respond to "I hope you aren't around me in 2 sips when I figure out how fast I can throw this coffee cup at your head."?

What the fuck.

My dad is threatening me just because I won't "shut the fuck up". Ugh, fuck him. I can talk whenever I want. I live here. He has nothing else to do with his time. Why would he be bothered by me not agreeing with him and not wanting to shut the fuck up. What the fuck is his issue? Why the fuck does he want to hurt me?

I'm so tired of this nonsense. It's just so irritating.
