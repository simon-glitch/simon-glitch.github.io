I'm so confused.

Very often, my dad asks me to shut up, and then when I tell him I did, he seems to get more upset. And and this is the important part, this part, when I try to talk to him about &lt;the topic of &lt;him telling me to shut up&gt;&gt;, he seemingly gets upset, about &lt;the topic of &lt;him telling me to shut up&gt;&gt;, and tells me to shut up, about that topic (not the original topic, but instead the new, recursive topic). And I just don't understand what his issue is. 

Pay very close attention to the &lt;angle brackets&gt;. I'm using them to encapsulate ideas and hopefully make this post more clear.
I just want to know why he gets so upset, and then specifically tells me to shut up. I also want to know why he always uses such a harsh tone. But, he doesn't want to justify himself. And if I ask him for any explanation about it, at any time, he immediately gets very upset.
Why though? Is he getting the topics confused? Is he remembering something that I'm not? If I want to talk to him about &lt;times when &lt;he tells me to shut up&gt;, generally speaking&gt;, why does he get so upset? He won't even let me finish the question. I understand that it's a bit long, but he just gets upset and tells me to shut up. I'm not trying to insult him or be mean, so he is clearly in the wrong for doing that.

That means I have the obligation to keep asking him about this until I can get a person explanation from him. I want to understand why he feels the way he does, because the occurence of his feelings make no sense to me.
He says I should "ask a mental therapist". That won't work, because this issue is related to his feelings, not mine.
He says I should "ask someone else", but that won't work either because they are not him and therefore will not understand his feelings well enough.

I can't tell what his issue is at all. It seems like he doesn't want to talk about this topic, but that's not very helpful. I need him to talk about this topic so I can understand him. This topic comes up a lot, and he calls me stupid a lot and gets very very upset very quickly about this topic specifically. Also, after I ask him about this topic, he usually (some time later) says he "wishes we could figure out how to talk to eachother". So, so... that means that he also wants me to understand.
He wants me to understand his feelings, but he explicitly says that he does not want that. The truth is clearly that he does, but he seems to think that he needs to hide his feelings and solve the problem of "figuring out how to talk to eachother". Does he not realize that those 2 things can not be done simultaneously?

Also (not very important), he likes to complain about how I'm "20 years old" and therefore "should understand this" or that I am just "too stupid to understand". He's the one who's stopping me from being able to understand, or at least he seems to be.
I'm not stupid or immature. He's just being uncooperative. The mature thing to do is try to understand other people's (in this case, his) feelings, obviously. I don't need to argue with him over that though. He seems to just want to insult me because he is upset. That's fine.
What's not fine is me not having an explanation. Honestly, genuinely, and quite importantly, it hurts my feelings, and I have a strong desire to get an explanation from him. It's bothering me that I don't understand his feelings, and it just hurts. Okay? It does. I'm not saying that he is hurting my feelings. I'm saying is lack of cooperation combined with the his distaste for this very specific topic is. And although the topic is specific, it comes up often enough that it genuinely feels like a thorn in my side, and the only actual negative thing I have to deal with in this household.

Is it a me problem? Yeah. Thankfully, it's the only problem I have to deal with. Or at least the only one I spend my daily thoughts focusing on. But that also means that I really do want to solve it.
