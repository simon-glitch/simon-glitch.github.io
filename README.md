I haven't really actually done any of these projects yet, since I don't really have the time, motivation, or confidence.

I will complete project #1 within the next 2 weeks.

## Aside
* (March 27, 2024)
At location `mySize - 1`. A really fast answer is that arrays and vectors are built in a left-to-right fashion. A better answer is that putting the top at 0 implies you are inserting at 0 and shifting ("pushing") the rest of the vector 1 index to the right. Obviously, shifting a vector/array requires 1 additional operation per item in it, which becomes impractical (or slow) for a large vector/array. I know you asked about a fixed-size array, but I would like to clarify that this answer also applies to vectors.
