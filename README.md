Current projects:
[priority | name | description]
[1 | King Taco | Web app for a card game, scripted via Python]
[2 | Matrices.js | Simple, performant library for working with matrices (linear algebra)]
[3 | SSIGM | My alt version of Orteil's Idle Game Maker]
[4 | Minesweeper | I want to make a good Minesweeper web app one of these days!]

I haven't really actually done any of these projects yet, since I don't really have the time, motivation, or confidence.

I will complete project #1 within the next 2 weeks.
