Long commit messages will sometimes be put here, for some slightly improve reading convenience.

> finally! it's working; add `console.log`s; keep track of which links have been set in `linked_insertion_sort_i`, and make all unset links map to the `L`, to mark that they are at the end of the list; there should only ever be one of them, so the code could be optimized based on that, but the code always takes O(n^2) single-thread and O(n) n-thread time anyways, so I don't really care; i wonder what a lot of threads will actually do with this code... i'll find out momentarily; i had to swap the indices in many calls of `data.compare`; i fixed the case for when `d[i] < d[j]`; it now checks for `i > ii` when `d[ii] == d[i]`; the code in `find` is quite messy, and could be improved a lot by drawing a diagram and checking all of the cases; having to make this sort stable complicates things, but I think you can use a RTL read to fix that issue; it also might actually help to use a ternary `compare` function instead of the binary one I am using; find the minimum item so we can map the "unset" links to the minimum item, and so we can start `linked_sort` at that; add `start` param to `linked_sort`, which does what you think: specifies the starting point (i.e. where the first chain is); i might want to also make the for loop for `linked_sort` loop around; remove `:)))` comment; make `compare` method actually index into the list instead of just directly comparing the indices; make `slice` properly handle negative indices; i realized that using mod (`%`) causes some issues; fix `get_bit_count` again; it now gives the correct number of bits, so `10 -> 8`, `200 -> 8`, `300 -> 16`, `2000 -> 16`, `50000 -> 16`, `65000 -> 16`, `67000 -> 32`, etc.; fix mapping step of `linked_sort`; we can just copy `d_c` directly to `d_a`, since that literally just sets `d_a` to itself; we need to `d_c[map[i]]`, to transform each `i` in `d_a` to `map[i]` in `d_c` (that's what index mapping is, afterall); um, change `max` to a easier value for testing; there were a lot of changes this commit, so the message is really long;
